PREFACE
Until quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language description proceeded almost entirely in isolation from one another. Work on theoretical linguistics, especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on English, and its results were felt to be inapplicable to those interested in describing other languages. Work on describing individual languages was almost deliberately isolationist, with the development of a different framework and terminology for each language or language group, and no feeding of the achievements of language description into linguistic theory. Within the last few years, however, a major rapprochement has taken pJace between theoretical and descriptive linguistics. In particular, the rise of language typology and the study of language universals have produced a large number of theoreticians who require accurate, well-formulated descriptive data from a wide range of languages, and have shown descriptive linguists that they can both derive benefit from and contribute to the development of linguistic theory. Even within generative syntax, long the bastion of linguistic anglocentrism, there is an increased interest in the relation between syntactic theory and a wide range of language types.
For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive linguistics, it is essential that descriptions of different languages should be comparable. The Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as lingua, vol. 42 (1977), No. I) provides a framework for the description of a language that is (a) sufficiently comprehensive to cover the major structures of any language that are likely to be of theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently explicit to make cross-language comparisons a feasible undertaking (in particular, through the detailed numbering key); and (c) sufficiently flexible to encompass the range of variety that is found in human language. The volumes that were published in the predecessor to the present series, the Linga Descriptive Studies (now available from Croom Helm), succeeded in bridging the gap between theory and description: authors include both theoreticians who are also interested in description (e.g. Peter Cole on Imbabura Quechua) and field-workers with an interest in theory (e.g. John Davis on Kobon).
The aim of the Croom Helm Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descriptions of a wide range of languages according to the format set out in the Questionnaire. Each language will be covered in a single volume. The first priority of the series is grammars of languages for which detailed descriptions are not at present available (thus, the monographs on Nkore-Kiga and Babungo are the first comprehensive descriptions of those languages). However, the series will also encompass descriptions of better-known languages with the series framework providing more detailed descriptions of such languages than are currently available (as with the monographs of West Greenlandic and Kannada).

INTRODUCTION
The Amele people inhabit an area of approximately 120 square kilometres between the Gum and Gogol rivers just south of the town of Madang in Papua New Guinea. The area extends fran the coast to about 14 kilometres inland. This is traditional Amele land and the Amele people appear to have been resident in this area for several centuries at least since there are local stories of events that happened some ti.Ire ago such as a major eruption of the volcano on Karkar island and a tidal wave that may or may not have been part of the same event. There is also a mythology, however, that the Amele people at some ti.Ire in the past came dawn fran sarewhere further inland to settle on the coast. This would seem to be confinned by the fact that, linguistically, the Amele language is typical of many highland Papuan languages. The figures for the 1977 na.tional census issued by the Madang District Office give a population of 5479 Arrele persons. Politically the people are governed by two organisations that appear to have an equal say in the running of Arrele society. On the one hand is the local government with its system of village courts for airing grievances and on the other hand is the indigenous Lutheran Church which ha? a large say in how Amele society functions. Lutheran missionaries first came to the Amele area in 1916. They established a church and a hospital. They also established ooconut plantations and a shipping canp:my to fund the church and the hospital. Today rrost Arrele people would call themselves "Christian". There is also a Ranan Catholic Church established in one Amele village at Aia. The Arrele people have therefore been influenced by the outside world for a long period of ti.Ire but still they maintain their traditional lifestyle of ~sistence farming.
As can be seen fran the map (p. 7) there are a nurrber of roads traversing the Amele area. The Lae-Madang road runs north-south near to the coast. The Jagaum road runs east-west and was constructed by the Lutherans. The
8

Introduction
MCMan road also runs east-west and was constructed by the Jant tinber canp:my. The Arrele area is therefore very accessible by road and rrost people live near to the roads although their gardens may be some way off fran where they live. The Arrele people do not normally live in large villages. Rather they prefer to live in small bamlets consisting of two or three or four family groups which are usually related by kinship. There is one large Amele village and this is Urwin by the coast where there are some 20 or 30 family groups living. The traditional lifestyle is one of subsistence farming and the agricultural rrethod employed is slash and burn. A new garden is planted each year in Decerriber or January at the beginning of the wet season. The staple crops are yams and taro. Other i.mp:>rtant crops grown include: sweet potato, plantains, sweet bananas, breadfruit, pawpaw, water rrelon, pineapple, mango, ooconut, and betelnut. Sane crops are grown for personal consumption and some as cash crops. The main cash crop is copra(dried ooconut). Surplus fruit and vegetables are taken into Madang to sell at the markets there. Pigs and chickens are also domesticated and usually roam freely in the village. Occasionally a pig or chicken is killed for food but people get rrost of their protein food fran the tinned rreat that can be purchased either in Madang or in one of the local trade stores. Very little genre hunting is practised since rrost of the genre is hunted out in the area. The only fauna that is still plentiful is birds and bats and either of these are a source of food. Most people build their houses raised on stilts off the ground made fran traditional material obtained fran the forest. It is becaning increasingly difficult to do this, however, since the slash and burn agriculture destroys the forest.
A cx:mnunity school system canprising three schools provides everyone with an education in English although it seems only a few people come out of the school system being able to understand and speak English fluently. As far as can be ascertained every Arrele is fluent in Tok Pisin as well as his own language. Most Arrele are also literate in Tok Pisin and can read the material that is available in Arrele. The extant Arrele literature a:mprises: extracts fran the Gospels called 'A Life of Jesus' by J. Welsch (1942,1949), a Catechism by A. Wullenkord (1928, 1949) and a hymnal and liturgy (1946, 1953, 1965). There is also a granmar and dictionary 'W5rterbuch und Grarrmatik der Arrelesprache' (circa 1930) by A. Wullenkord but this is not available to the Arrele people since there is only one copy. Previously people were taught to read and write their own language but this was discontinued some ti.Ire in the 1970's. Now all education is conducted in English.

Introduction

The Arnele language is the largest of the Gum family of

languages, previously known as the Abaian language family
(z 'graggen 1975: 13 and Wunn 1975: 582) · There are five other

languages in the Gum family: Sihan, Gurralu, Isebe, Bau,

Panim. The Gum language family belongs to the Mabuso Stock,

Madang Super-stock of the Madang-Adelbert Range Sub-fhylum.

There are four distinct dialects of Arnele and these are

marked areally on the rrap. The dialects are: (1) Haia,

which includes the villages of Kesub, Jahil, Danben and

Jelso, (2) Arnele, which includes the villages of Sinan,

Hobai, Ahob, Balilna, Aia, Salugu and Arnele, (3) Huar, which

includes the villages of Wagug, Hudini, Banub, Aguru, Sah,

Omuru, Sein, Ohuru, Umuin, Bahor and ord, and (4) Jagahala,

which includes the village of Ohu. These dialect ooundaries

are recognised by the Arnele people themselves, hence the

local tenninology, and have been substantiated by linguistic

research (Roberts 1980). There are phonological,

gramnatical and lexical differences between the four

dialects but all are mutually intelligible except possibly

for the Jagahala dialect which only has a rraximum cognition

rate with the other dialects of 00%. The Jagahala dialect

wculd appear to be rrore closely related to the neighbouring

Isebe language. The present study was conducted primarily

in the Haia dialect as this is recognised by the people as

the rrost prestigious of the dialects. Also the existing

literature is in the Haia dialect. The only known previous

descriptions of the language are Wullenkord (circa 1930) and

Roberts (1979,1980,198la,198lb). As well as Z'graggen (1975

and 1980 and Wunn 1975) the language is also rrentioned in

Capell (1969). For references to New Guinea Pidgin (Tok

Pisin) see Mihalic (1971).

The orthography that is used in this description is

basically that proposed by Wullenkord and Welsch but with
sane rrodification. The phonemes /b/ and /g/ are represented

phonemically with one syrrbol ~ and3 respectively rather
than alloPhonically with two syrrbols E.!Jl. and g/k as before.
The phoneme /?/ is represented in all instances by the

syrrbol c rather than by the apostrophe syrrbol ' word initialIy and by c in other word places. The long-~ls

[e:] and [:>:] are rei?resented by their underlying fonns ee
aand 00 respectively rather than by the dieretic ~ls and a. The diphthong sequence /ai/ is represented in- all
aeInstances by ai. Previously this sequence was acmetimes
represented by aS in words like sa.en I time I and taen
'cloud' · The diphthong sequence /ei/ is also represented in all instances by ei. Previously, in sane verbal

·conjugations, this sequence was represented by just e, for

example £ea [fe:n] 'he saw' ·

-

Arnele is a typical Papuan language with SOV l::asic word

order, clause chaining, serial verbs, impersonal verbs and a

switch-reference system. Sare of the interesting features

10

Introduction
of the language are (i) how the switch-reference system has taken on a pragmatic/deictic role as well as a syntactic role, (ii) how the switch-reference system interacts with the impersonal verbs to distinguish agentive from nonagentive subjects (iii) the expression of acme seventeen different kinds of m:JOd rrainly through sentence postposed particles, and (iv) an inalienably possessed noun system that can distinguish the person and nunber of the possessor as well as the nunber of the possessee.
This description was originally presented as IT\Y doctoral thesis for a PhD in Linguistics at London University. The data for this study were collected during periods of residence in Danben village from February 1978 to June 1981 and later from August 1984 to November 1985. The corpus of data included acme 35 texts together with much elicited infonnation from native Arnele speakers. Work began on researching the answers to the Croom Helm (fonnerly Lingua) Descriptive Series questionnaire in August 1984 and it was possible to type up a first draft of the whole manuscript on a Sharp PC5000 portable comp.lter in Danben village itself.
During all periods of residence in ENG I was working under the auspices of the Sumner Institute of Linguistics and I want to thank the ENG Branch for their encouragement and assistance in a::mpleting this project. I would also like to thank IT\Y supervising professor, Neil Smith of London University, for all his helpful carments and suggestions on the earlier drafts of the thesis. Professor Bernard Comrie of the University of Southern California also gave rre much helpful advice and assistance during the time he was conducting a workshop for SIL in ENG. I would also like to thank Arnele friends whom I worked with closely during IT\Y times in PNG, especially Pastor Gulal(IXJW deceased), Pastor Liwa MBE, Israel Liwa, Naus, Misangul and Ruth. While every endeavour has been made to rrake the answers to the questionnaire as accurate as · possible according to native speaker intuitions any errors in fact or analysis remain the responsibility of the author.

1.1.1.1. Dizect. speech and :indirect speech.

The language can distinguish direct speech fran indirect speech although, While direct quotes are very
aamon in text rra.terial, indirect quotes are quite rare.

(1) Direct~· The direct quote sentence is normally narked by a speech

verb :i.mnediately preceding the quoted speech, and a repeat

quote predicate, Which is a copy of the suffixation of the

speech verb, :imnediately follows the quote. The verb

preceding and the verb/verb suffixation following the quote

have· identical person-ntmi::ler-tense-aspect-m:x>d inflection.

While the <Xltbination of speech verb preceding and verbal

suffixation following is the nost aamon <Xltbination in text

other <Xltbinations can occur. For example a CX>P.f of the

whole speech verb can occur or, in a series of quotes, the

initial speech verb can be anitted and just the. copy of. the

verbal suffixation can remain. The quote is the direct

object of the speech verb. Within the eril:>edded quotation

sentence the choice and order of oonstituents is the same as

for the normal declarative sentence (see 1.2.1.2.5-6.) · The

speech verb nost cx:rmatl.y used is JIEld-ec 'to say' although

others can occur like, cis-doc 'to think' or sisil.-doc 'to

ask· · Alternatively DEld-ec can a:::d>ine with other verbs in

a paratactic oonstruction to produce a variant meaning or

can be nodified by adverbials.

possible. With such embedding usually only the speech verb

on the top-rrost level is copied to the postquote position or

alternatively the copied verb suffixation can be corrbined to
form a "cx:mposite" copy of the speech verbs as in (16)

(2) Indirect~· As stated above indirect speech is rare but it does occur. In text indirect speech is rrarked only by verbal suffixation following the indirect quote. There is no speech verb. Since the indirect quote can be expressed frcm either the point of viev.r of the reporter or frcm the point of viev.r of the repartee (i.e. the one whose speech is being reported) it can'sc:mati:rres be difficult to decide whether a particular piece of text is an indirect or direct quote and it seems that the presence or absence of a speech verb is critical in

The above examples illustrate ha.v native speakers express

indirect speech in unelicited text h~ver, when questioned

as to ha.v indirect speech should be expressed in Arrele,

native speakers described a different, fuller, fonn. In

this fonn the indirect quote sentence is marked by a

naninalizing p::>stclitic -ec and the indirect quote is then

followed by a speech verb. No speech verb precedes the

indirect quote and in this respect the indirect quote fonn

differs from the nonnal direct quote where a speech verb

precedes the direct quote. As mentioned previously the

indirect quote can be expressed either from the p::>int of

view of the rep::>rter as in (25) or the rep::>rtee as in (26).
There is no problem with ambiguity with these sentences for

Arrele speakers. In OOth cases the subject of the erril::Jedded

reported quote clause must always refer to the rep::>rtee and

cannot refer to the rep::>rter. (25) lqa \qadec jdxn na h-ugi~

1.1.1. 2. Intenogative sentences.

There are three basic types of interrogative sentences: yes-no questions (see 1.1.1. 2.1. ) , question word questions (see 1.1.1.2.2.) and alternative questions (see 1.1.1.2.1.
3. ) · All question types are marked by the rrorphology. The basic intonation pattern is the same as for the declarative sentence (see 3.3.4.1.).

1.1.1.2.1. Yes-no questions.

A distinction can be made between neutral ,yes-no questions, where the speaker is not predisp::>sed to expect an affirmative or negative resp::>nse to his question, and leading yes-no questions, where the speaker expects an affirmative resp::>nse to his question.

1.1.1.2.1.1. Neutral yes-no questions.

The neutral yes-no interrogative sentence, where either a 'yes' or a 'no' response can be expected, expresses the p::>sitive and negative prop::>Sitions as alternatives and normally the p::>sitive prop::>sition is expressed first. The neutral yes-no question is marked firstly by the
interrogative rrood particle :fo in sentence final p::>sition followed by either just the negative particle qee and a further interrogative rrood particle :fo or, optionally, if the predicate is verbless, a negation of the p::>Sitive prop::>sition foll~ by the interrogative rrood particle. Also there is a rising, nonfinal intonation pattern on the first interrogative particle and a falling, final intonation
pattern on the final interrogative particle (see also 3. 3. 4.1. ) · The structure of the neutral question is as diagrarrmed in [1].

1.1.1.2.1.2. Leading yes-no questions.

Leading yes-no question sentences are of two kinds. One expects an affinnative response and the other expects a
negative response.

(1) Affinrative leading yes-no question.

The affinrative leading yes-no question expresses the

interrogative rcood Where the speaker expects the hearer to

concur with the proposition expressed Whether that

proposition is positive or negative. The sentence is narked

by the interrogative rcood particle fo in sentence final

position(see also 2.1.3.4.2.). In the case Where the

affinrative leading yes-oo question expresses a negative

proposition it is interesting to note that the hearer's

concurrence with the proposition is expressed by an

affinrative response word (see (35)) and that the hearer's

ncnconcurrence with the proposition is expressed by a

negative response -word (see (36t) · Thus:

(33)

'Did you not see that man?'

B: Qee, ija £-ig-a.

no ls see-ls-tod.p

'No, I saw (him) · '

(2) Negative leading yes-no question.

The negative lea.ding yes-no question expresses the dubitive

rcood Where the speaker does not expect the hearer to concur

with the proposition expressed Whether that proposition is

positive or negative. The sentence is narked by the

dlbitive rcood particle fa in sentence final position (see

also 2.1.3.4.10.).

1.1.1.2.1.3. Alternative.yes-no questions.

Questions asking for a choice between alternative

propositions are narked in the sane way as the neutral

leading yes-no question (see 1.1.1. 2.1.1. ) except that the

second alternative rrrust be expressed overtly and the

interrogative narker fo is optional at the end of the second

alternative. Otherwise the narking is the sane as for the

neutral

leading

question, i.e. the alternative

interrogative conjunction fo occurs sentence finally after

the first alternative followed by the negative particle

qee. The alternative can be expressed on any elem:mt of the

sentence. The second alternative rrrust include the phrase

expressing the alternation and the predicate. Other

elem:mts than the first alternative are nonra.lly

deleted in the second alternative sentence.

The

structure of the alternative yes-no question is

diagramned in [2]. The illustrative sentences exemplify

alternation en subject(a), direct object(b), indirect

eel sain 'When (What time)?'

sain ganic 'What time is it?'

It is apparent that the interrogative element of a mmber of

interrogative words is the vowel 'a' . This can be seen When

the interrogative word is canprred with its noninterrogative

equivalent.

cf. aili 'hc:M' and edi 'like this' ocli I like that I

ai 'Which' and i 'this'

eu 'that'

OU 'that'

ana 'Where' and ene 'here'

cmo 'there'

Within the interrogative word series itself the vowel 'a'

also indicates plurality (see also 2.1.2.6.1.).

cf. eel and ail

in and an In a questien asking for.the specification of a locatien the

interrogative ai is used When the locatien is proximal i.e.

within view, and the interrogative ana is used When the

location is not proximal i.e. not necessarily within view.

The interrogative ganic can be used to question either

cnuntable or noncountable quantity.

It is p:>ssible to question any constituent in the subordinate clause with a question word either as a non-echo
question or as an echo question. When questioned as a non-echo question the questioned element is rroved to the preverbal focus p:>sition nonnally occupied by the direct object. When questioned as an echo question the questioned
element remains in its nonnal clausal p:>sition.

Condition clause.

Any element can be questioned in the conditional clause but

if the subject is questioned in the subordinate clause it

cannot be rrarked as coreferential with the subject of the

matrix clause. Similarly if the subject is questioned in

the rratrix clause the subject of the subordinate clause

cannot be rrarked as coreferential with it. Rather when the

subject of either the subordinate conditional clause or the

subject of the rratrix clause is questioned then the verb in

the subordinate clause must be rrarked for noncoreferential

subject following. When the subject of the subordinate

clause is questioned then the subordinate clause must be

end-shifted to the end of the sentence.

Non-echo question - subject.

1.1. 1. 3. lnpel:ati.ve sentences.

Imperative sentences can be positive (o::.rmand) or negative (prohibition). In each case the sentence is marked as imperative by special suffixation of the verbal element or of the final verbal element in a coordinated verb series. In the latter case the imperative rrood enccmpasses all the
verbs in the sentence. The negative imperative sentence contains the prohibitive particle ~ 'don't' preceding the verb as part of the verb phrase and the verb is also marked for negative future tense. The imperative rrood, like the
debitive, hortatory and prescriptive rroods (see 2.1.3.4.8,12 and 19), indicates a necessity for a situation to take place. The imperative rrood prescribes a situation relating to the inmediate tine and place and the speaker requires inmediate ccmpliance. The degree of CXXllp.llsion is high.

1.1. 2. Subardinatic.n.

There are two kinds of rredial clause in Amele - those that have subordinate rredial verbs and those that have
coordinate rredial verbs. The distinction between these two types of clause lies in (i) their structure within the sentence, (ii) the p::>ssibility of tense/m:xxl desinence on the verb, (iii) the scope of negation across clauses and (iv) subject NP coreference by the switch-reference system.
A subordinated clause is embedded within another clause

43

Syntax

having the structure s[s[s[ ]··. ].·· ]and is syntactically

on a different level of structure from the superordinate

clause in which it is embedded. The subordinate rredial

verb can therefore be specified for independent tense/rrood

desinence from the superordinate rratrix verb.

This

contrasts with coordinate rredial clauses (see 1. 3.1.1.4. )
which have the structure s[s[ Js[ Js[ ]·.. ]and are on the

same level of syntactic structure as other clauses in the

coordinate chain. With coordinate rredial verbs tense/rrood

desinence is dependent on the tense/rrood desinence of the

final verb in the coordinate clause chain which is usually

the final clause in the sentence.3 This is illustrated in

(160) below. The subordinated sentence is set off with

square brackets. The final verb in this sentence,

meciegina, is specified for present tense whereas the final

verb in the rratrix sentence, jaD, is specified for rerrote

past tense. The particle that negates the verb can also

detennine what is a subordinate clause and what is a

coordinate clause. The scope of a negating particle is

limited to the subordinate clause in which it occurs and

does not carry aver into the superordinate clause whereas

the scope of a negating particle applies to all the clauses

in a coordinate clause chain which follow the clause in

which the negating particle occurs (see 1.4. 4-5. ) · Another

factor that detennines a subordinate clause from a

coordinate clause is haw subject NP's are coreferenced by

the switch-reference system (see also 2.1.3.6. 7.). Where

there is a chaip. of coordinate clauses the switch-reference

rrarkers will coreference the .imnedi.ately following clause as having same or different subject (SS or IB). ~ver where

will skip aver this clause and coreference the next clause on the same gramnatical level. This is illustrated by (160)

below. The crucial verb bimeb 'we came up-SS' is

underlined. This verb does not coreference the subject

of the .imnedi.ately following verb mJdimeig 'they make'

since it belongs to a subordinated sentence, the final

verb of which is meciegina 'they see' · bimeb in fact

coreferences the subject of the final verb of the rratrix

sentence jcm 'we ate' which happens to be the final

verb in the coordinate clause chain of the rratri;x

has a coordinate clause chain within itself containing two

clauses.

Subordinate clauses can also be rrarked by word order, subordinating particles and clitics, and other means (see below).

1.1. 2.1. Genera:l markers of subal:dinaticn.

Subordinate clauses can be rrarked by the following

means:

(i) Word order.

A subordinate clause norrrally precedes the verb of the

superordinate clause and any argurcents of that verb which

are not expressed in the subordinate clause itself. A

clause can function as a subordinate clause with no special

rrarking and in this case it must precede the verb in the

superordinate clause. A clause can function as the embedded

quote clause in the quotation sentence and in this case the

quote verb functions as the special rrarking of the

subordinate quote clause. The quote verb no:anally precedes

the quote clause with verbal suffixation copied from the

quote verb following the quote (see 1.1.1.1. ) ·

(162)Ija sab faj-ig-en h-ug-a.

ls food buy-ls-fut. cane-ls-tod.p

'I came to buy food. '

(ii) Subordinating particles.

Mood particles, postpositions and derronstratives can all

function as subordinating particles.

(1) Mood particles.

The conditional rrood particle fi 'if' functions as a

subordinating particle and follows the subordinated clause.

The subordinated conditional clause no:anally precedes the

superordinate clause but it can be end-shifted for special

focus. The subordinated clause can contain a nonfinite

rredial verb or a finite verb. When the verb is a rredial

verb with same subject foll,owing the conditional rrood

particle is incorporated in the verb suffixation and

replaces the same subject suffixation (see 1.1.2.4.2. 7. and

2.1.3.4.4.).

The contrafactual rrood particle mi 'if' functions as a

subordinating particle and follows the subordinated clause.

The subordinated contrafactual clause no:anally precedes the

superordinate clause but it can be end-shifted for special

focus. Where there is a clause final verb in the

subordinated clause it rrrust be rrarked for contrafactual rrood

(see 1.1.2.4.2.8. and 2.1.3.4.20.).

The certain apprehensive particle dain 'lest' can function

as a subordinating particle in which case it follows

45

Syntax

the subordinated clause. In this construction the

subordinate apprehensive clause follows the superordinate

clause. The verb in the subordinate clause must be either

an infinitive verb or narked for negative future tense (see

also 1.1.2.4.2.ll. and 2.1.3.4.17.). The subordinate clause is in square brackets in the example (163) below.

(2) Postp:>sitions. The postp:>sition na 'in/at/with' functions as

a

subordinating particle in the time, place and instrument

adverbial clauses (see 1.1.2.4.2.1-3). The postp:>sition JU
'cause/for' functions as a subordinating particle in the purpose and cause adverbial clauses (see 1.1.2.4.2.5-6.).

The postp:>sition -we ,-like' ,can function as a subordinating

particle in the equative _adverbial clause (see 1.1.2.4.2.

12.).

(3) Dem:nstrative. The denalstrative eu 'that' functions as the optional

subordinating oonjunction in the relative clause (see 1.1.2.

3.).

(iii) Subordinating clitic.
'!he clitic ;c/-oc functions to subordinate the quote in the
indirect quotation sentence (see 1.1.1.1.). The clitic

follows the indirect quote clause which precedes the quote
verb. The clitic -ec/-oc also functions as a subordinating

element in the prem:xlified noun phrase. It naninalizes the

clause preceding the head noun (see 1.1.2. 2. and 1.2. 5. ) ·

(iv) Verbal subordinators.
The verbal element Olli 'like that' functions as a subordinator in the nanner adverbial clause following the

subordinated clause (see 1.1.2.4.2.4.). The verbal element

bili 'to be' functions as a subordinator in the purpose adverbial clause (see 1.1.2.4.2.5.). It functions as an

optional element following the subordinated clause.

1.1.2.3. Mjective clauses (relative clauses).
1.1.2.3.1. Marking of the relative clause.
The adjective or relative clause functions as a subordinate clause within the 11\3.trix sentence and as such is 11\3.rked with a nonfinal intonation pattern ( see 3. 3. 4 .1. ) and optionally by the subordinating derronstrative conjunction eu 'that' which follows the relative clause. The relative clause is further 11\3.rked by the fact that the head noun (rel NP) (i.e. the relativized element within the relative clause) is front-shifted and always occurs in the clause initial r:osition regardless of its syntactic relationship within the clause. The relativized head noun also preferably occurs as the first element in the 11\3.trix sentence although this is not obligatory. The relative clause can also be rrarked in the cases where the relativized element is functioning as temp:>ral, locative or instrument in the 11\3.trix sentence. In these cases the r:ostr:osition na 'at/in/by/with' follows the subordinating conjunction eu. The antecedent noun phrase (ant:. NP) is normally deleted if it is not required for purposes of disambiguation or E!mfhasis. The ant NP, when present, occurs preceding the 11\3.trix superordinate verb in its norll\3.1 syntactic r:osition. Amele therefore has a replacive relative clause strategy as its prill\3.ry relativizing strategy.4 The structure of the relative clause in relation to the 11\3.trix sentence is as diagranrned in [3] below.

1.1.2.3.2. The distinction between restrictive and nonrestricti""""Ve relative clauses.
The nonrestrictive relative clause is syntactically similar to the restrictive relative clause (see 1.1.2. 3.1. ) but is distinct from the restrictive relative clause in several respects. The nonrestrictive relative clause functions as a ncrninal clause in apposition to the preceding ncrninal. As such it is set apart by its awn nonfinal intonation pattern (see 3.3.4.1.). Also the nonrestrictive relative clause can be end-shifted to the end of the 11\3.trix sentence whereas the restrictive relative clause cannot be. The nonrestrictive clause cannot by itself be a distinct intonational unit or by itself 11\3.Ilifest a distinct syntactic

1.1.2.3.3-4·.~position of the head~ and the treatment of the relativized element.

The Amele relative clause is analyzed as a replacive

relative clause strategy. In this strategy the head noun

(HN) is replaced by the relative clause (RC) itself,

although the RC contains an element corresponding to the HN

i.e. the relativized element (rel NP). The replacive

strategy is normal and in this case no HN or antecedent noun

phrase (ant NP) occurs in the superordinate clause.

Occasionally, ha.Never, it is necessary to repeat the rel NP

in the superordinate clause for the purpose of

disarribiguating the content of the rel NP in the RC or for

errlfhasizing the rel NP. In this case the repeated rel NP is

functioning as an ant NP. For example in (183) there "WOUld

be two possible interpretations as to the content of the rel

NP. The two possibilities can be resolved by repetition of

the rel NP in the superordinate clause as in (184) and

(185).

infinitive fonn, and {ii) by the relative future tense {see

2. L 3. 2.) expressing the notion of 'being about to .do scmething· · The purpose clause realized by a relative
future tense verb can be optionally followed by the verbal particle bi.li expressing durative aspect {see 2.1.3.3.2.L

1.1.2.4.3. Nonfinite adverb clauses.

Tine, place and instrtment adverbial clauses must always be finite since they are relative clauses relativized en temp:>ral, locative and instrtmental naninals. Manner adverbial clauses are :infinitive when the manner word is interrogative otherwise they are finite. Purpose adverbial clauses can have a future tense or infinitive verb fonn. Cause adverbial clauses must have finite verb fonns. Conditiooal adverbial clauses can be finite or nonfinite or
verbless equative clause fonns. Contrafactual adverbial clauses can ally be nonfinite when verbal since the verb must be nerked for the a:mtrafactual rrood and cannot be
nerked for tense. otherwise the a:mtrafactual adverbial clause can be a verbless equative clause. A};:prehensive
adverbial clauses can be finite or infinitive. The equative

degree adverbial clauses must be infinitive. The debitive adverbial clause must be infinitive. The impllsive desire adverbial clause must be finite and the oontrafactual and 'habitual desire adverbial clauses must be nonfinite (see 2. . 1.3.5. for a description of finite and nonfinite verb forms).

A CDpilar verb is a verb Whose nain neaning is ~en from the preceding naninal, adjectival or adverbi~l a:xnplement. There is no overt 'be 1-ex>pula verb as in English; rather ex>pular .sentences can be verbal with the verbs bi1-ec 'to sit/be', nij-ec 'to lie/be', taw-ec 'to stand/be', m-ec 'to pit/beocme' and. q-oc 'to hit/have' functioning as ex>pular verbs. All ex>pular verbs can also function as regular verbs. Copular sentences can also be ncnverbal equational sentences with a naninal, adjective or adverbial functioning as predicate. The order of aonstituents in the verbal CDpilar sentence is the same as the order of CDnstituents in the nonex>pular verbal sentence (see 1.2.1.2.6.).

1.2.1.2.1. Subject.
A subject is obligatory with all predicates transitive, intransitive, ditransitive, quotation, copular and nonverbal (see 1.2.1.1.4.) except where the verb is in the infinitive fo:rm when an overt subject NP is optional. Except for the infinitive fonn person and nunber of the subject is obligatorily indicated by suffixation on the verb (see 2.1.3.6.1.1.). The subject can be either first, second or third person and either singular, dual or plural nurrber. For all fonns of the verb except the impersonal verb an overt subject (naninal or proncminal) is optional. For the impersonal verb (see 2.1.3.8.) an overt subject NP is obligatorily present when the verb is type (i) expressing a cause and obligatorily absent when the verb is type {ii) expressing no overt cause. An overt subject NP is also obligatorily absent in a certain verbal construction of the subordinated certain apprehension clause where the subject of the superordinate verb is coreferential with the object of the subordinate verb in the apprehensive clause as in (281) below (see also 1.1.2.4.2.11.). The subject is usually identified by either a noun phrase·or a pronoun but where identity is clearly established, e.g. in dialogue or narrative, the subject can be indicated by verbal suffix alone. Also clause chaining occurs such that many clauses can occur in a single sentence and in these clauses the verb has rrorphology which indicates the identity of the subject of the following clause as to whether it is the same or different frcrn the preceding clause (see 2.1.3.6.7.).

1.2.1.2.2. ~object.

The category of direct object can be established on the

basis of word order and special object suffixation on the

verb (see 2.1.3.6.1.2-3.). There are distinct classes of

verbs based on whether they can t:JCcur with an overt object NP - transitive and intransitive. However verbs can also be divided into what is termed 'goal-oriented' vs.

'agent-oriented' verbs depending en whether an object clitic

is obligatorily present or absent in the infinitive form of

the verb and the categories of transitive and intransitive

verbs vs. goal-oriented and agent-oriented verbs do not

necessarily coincide · (see 2. 1. 3.6. 1. 2-3 · for further

description and illustrations.) If an intransitive verb occurs in a paratactic sequence with a transitive verb the

predicate is transitive (see also 2.1.3. 7.). The semantic functions of the direct object are accusative and

experiencier.

1.2.1.2.3. Indirect object.

The category of indirect object can be established on

the basis of word order and object suffixation on the verb.

The direct object proncminal clitic attaches directly to the

verb stern with no intervening predicate marker. The

indirect object pronan:inal clitic, on the other hand,

attaches to the verb with an intervening predicate marker

(see 2.1.3.6.12.1.11. and 2.1.3.6.1.2-3.). The indirect

object can occur either as an overt NP or as a pronan:inal

clitic on the verb or as both, although rrost ccrirronly the

indirect object occurs cnly as a pronan:inal clitic on the

verb. The semantic functions of the indirect object are

recipient,

benefactive, rralefactive, allative and

ablative.

1. 2.1. 2. 4. Other verbal arguments.

Other verbal argurrents that are obligatory but are not

encoded in the predicate are (i) the quote clause in the

quotation sentence (see 1.1.1.1.) and (ii) the subject in

the equative clause (see 1. 2.1.1. ) · All other verbal

argurrents are optional and include: (i) the time, place,

instrument, rranner,

purpose,

contrafactual, apprehension, equative degree, debitive and

optative adverbial argurrents and (ii) the a:irnitative

directional and ablative postpositional argurrents.

1. 2. 1. 2. 5. Caribinations of arguments.

In the transitive,' intransitive and ditransitive sentence there is no restriction on caribinations of optional elements given in 1.2.1.2.4. but rarely do rrore than two or three optional elements occur in one clause in text. Quote
and complement do not occur in these sentences. With the equative(verbless) copular sentence optional elements are restricted to terrqx:>ral, locative, accompanier, conditional

and ablati~e. For the transitive clause subject and direct

object are Obligatory and there is no indirect object. For

the intransitive clause subject is obligatory, and direct

clause subject, direct and indirect object are Obligatory.

For the equative copular clause subject and complement are

obligatory, and direct and indirect objects do not occur.

For the quotation sentence the quote functioning as direct

object is obligatory. Where a sentence with many ~anal

L 2. L 2. 6. Order of constituents.

A statistical count was made of six representative

texts to determine the unmarked (i.e. statistically the rrost

frequent) order of constituents. The six texts were

transcribed oral texts frcm six different authors. The

types and sizes of the texts varied. There were two

historical narratives, two folk tales, one procedural and

one e:iqository(serrron) text. The lengths varied frcm 24

sentences (82 clauses) for one of the historical narratives

to 75 sentences (241) clauses for one of the folk tales.

The maximum nurrber of clauses per sentence in any one text

was 13 in text no. 17, a historical narrative and the

average nurrber of clauses per sentence over the whole corpus

of data was 3 clauses per sentence. The overall quantity of

text was 284 sentences (853 clauses) · Details of the

statistics for each text is charted below (table 1.1) · The

chart details the occurrences of various orders of the

main constituents viz. S(Subject), IO(Indirect object),

OO(Direct object) and V(Verb) and also scrne of the

nnre comron optional constitutents

viz. ternp:>ral,

locative and instrurrent. The patterns that emerge frcm

this analysis is that the unmarked order for the main

cx::instituents is S IO 00 V. This order can vary,

ha.Never, since there are two possible landing sites for

rroved elements preceding the verb. These are sentence

initial thematic position and the preverbal object focal

position. Thus it is possible for an abject NP to be

70

Syntax
front-shifted to the thematic position and for a subject NP to be shifted to the preverbal .rx>sition. Where an indirect object and direct object NP occur in the same sentence the indirect object always precedes the direct object. With the optional elements order is rrore fluid between themselves and a count was made only with sane of the rrore connon constituents and only with regard to their position in relation to the main constituents. The analysis reveals that the Subject NP invariably precedes any other NP, optional or otherwise, and occupies the sentence initial .rx>sition although again this is not rigidly fixed. The analysis also reveals that optional elements like instrurrent tend to precede the direct abject NP although they can follow the direct abject and occur in the preverbal position.

The class of word 'adverb' is not fonnally distinguished :Eran noun and adjective (see 1.16. 7. ) and the items in this section are described on the basis of adverbial function alone. Adverbs have the following syntactic and semantic-functions: (1) Adverbials in the sentence functioning as adverbs of
Time Place Manner Degree Interrogation (interrogative adverbs) Affinnation Negation Independent adverbs (2) Adverbial m:xlifier of adjective adverb postpositional phrase determiner noun phrase (3) Conplement of a postposition. An adverb can be simple, cornp::lund, reduplicated or duplicated. Elements that can have an adverbial function apart from adverbial words are an adverbial phrase (see 1. 2. 3.), an adverbial clause (see 1.1.2.4.), a noun phrase and a postpositional phrase. All adverbials precede the verb.

Postpositional phrases can function as the following

adverbials. The postposition na 'at/on/with/by' can

function in the temp.:>ral, locative and instrumental

adverbial phrases. The postposition ca 'with/add' can

function in the aca::impanier adverbial phrase and also as an

emphatic element in the ternp:>ral and locative adverbial

phrase. The p:>stposition nu 'for/cause' functions in the

purpose and cause adverbial phrases. The postposition dee

1.2.1.3.1.4. Adverbial clauses.

Adverbial clauses are also described under 1.1. 2·4. There are five subtypes of adverbial clause:
(1) Those in which the verb carries verb-final inflection and the clause functions as a relative clause rrodifying a
temporal, locative or instrurrental ncminal. (2) Those in which the clause functions as object of the postposition in the purpose and cause adverbial clauses. (3) Those in which the clause is subordinated by a subordinating particle i.e. the adverbial clauses of marmer,
conditionality, contrafactuality and apprehension (4) Those in which the clause functions as <XJrnplement in an impersonal verb construction.

1.2.1.3.2. Position of adverbials and relative order of

cooccurring ~· -

-- --- -

The position and order of adverbials is not rigid (see 1.2.1.2.6.). The adverbial expressing marmer normally irrmediately precedes the verb following a direct object if there is one present. othenvise adverbial elements normally occur between the subject and the object (direct or indirect). The adverbial postpositional phrase expressing
accompanirrent must irrmediately follow the subject except when questioned in the nonecho question in which case it is rroved to the preverbal object position (see 1.1.1.2.2.2.).
A normal ordering for adverbial elements where they do cooccur would be as shown in table 1. 2 below:

Table 1. 2: order of Adverbial Elements

1. 2.1. 3. 3. Obligatoriness of adverbials.
Adverbials are only obligatory in the impersonal verb constructions expressing debitive and optative rrood (see 1. 1.2.4.2.13-14.). otherwise adverbials are not obligatory in any constructions.

1. 2. 5.1. Operati.aJa.l de:finiti.al fur noun phrase.
The noun phrase is the structural unit which rranifests the subject, direct object, indirect object, t.emforal, locative, manner and ccmplernent functions of the clause and as equational predicate in the equational clause. It also functions as the object 6f the postposition in the t.emforal, locative, instrunent, alienably possessed, comitative, circumstantial, reflexive, purpose, cause, ablative, analogic, directional and origin postpositional phrases. There are five types of noun phrase. The first three types i.e. postm::xlified, prem:xlified and canpound noun phrase can manifest any of the above functions. The fourth type, the duplicated noun phrase,- rrost c:xm:only has an adjectival or adverbial function (see 1. 2. 2. 1. and 1. 2.1. 3. 1.1. ) · The inalienably possessed noun phrase can only rranifest the functions of subject, direct or indirect object and ccmplernent and also functions as object in the comitative, reflexive, purpose, cause, analogic and directional postpositional phrases. (1) The pgstm::xlified ~phrase consists of either a pronoun, noun, adjective, indefinite article, quantifier, or derocmstrative adjective alone or a noun, postrrodified noun phrase, canpound noun phrase or inalienably possessed noun phrase functioning as head with one or rrore :rrodifiers following. The following rrodifiers can be an adjective, adjective phrase, adjectivalizing clause indefinite article, quantifier, dem:mstrative adjective, ern.rilatic word, interrogative adjective, negative particle, or finite adjectivalizing past participle. The relative clause adopts a replacive strategy (see 1.1.2.3.). There are no possessive adjectives; rather alienable possession is expressed by a postpositional phrase (see 1.2.4., 1.2.5.2.3. and 2.1.1.4.6.1.) and inalienable possessedness is expressed by a closed set of nouns (see 2.1.1.4.7.1.). Possession can also be expressed by a canpound noun phrase (see (3) below). (368)Uqa 00-i-a..

1.3.1.1.4. -Co-or-di-na-te -m-ed-ia-l -ve-rb-s.
The rrost cormon maans of =rdinating sentences or clauses is by aJOrdinate medial verb suffixation. There are two types of aJOrdinate medial verb: (i) sequential action medial verbs (described under 2.1.3.3.2.1.1. perfective aspect) and (ii) simultaneous action medial verbs (described under 2.1.3.3.2.1.2. imperfective aspect). Sequential action medial verbs describe a related series of consecutive events Whereas simultaneous action verbs describe a ternp:>ral overlap of concurrent events. Both types of verb can be marked for the person-nurrber of the subject of the verb and also for coreferentiality or noncoreferentiality with the subject of the following verb. See 2.1.3.6. 7. for a full description of What constitutes same subject following (SS) and What constitutes different subject following (DS). Coordinate medial clauses are distinguished from subordinate medial clauses on the basis of (i) their structure within the sentence, (ii) the possibility of tense/rrood desinence on the verb, (iii) the scope of negation across clauses and (iv) subject NP coreference by the switch-reference system (see 1.1.2.). Clauses with subordinate medial verbs form a structure Where one clause is erribedded within another, s[s[s[ ] ..· ] ... ]. Whereas clauses' with aJOrdinate medial verbs form a structure of concatenated clauses i.e. a clause chain, s[s[ J s[ J s[ ] ··· ]. Only the final clause in the chain is marked for tense/rrood and this tense/rrood applies to the other verbs in the chain. With subordinate medial verbs on the other hand there is the possibility of independent tense/rrood desinence from the tense/rrood of the verb in the superordinate rratrix clause since they are on a different level syntactically from the rratrix verb. Also, whereas in a subordinate clause the scope of a negating particle is limited to the subordinate clause in Which it occurs, in a aJOrdinate clause the scope of a negating particle applies to all the clauses in the aJOrdinate chain following the clause in Which the particle occurs (see 1.1.1.3.2. and 1.4.4-5.).
With verbs marked for SS, both sequential and simultaneous verbs, tense/rrood desinence is completely dependent on the tense/rrood of the final verb. With verbs marked for DS tense/rrood desinence is completely dependent for the sequential verb but for the DS simultaneous verb realis and irrealis tense/rrood can be distinguished by the suffixation on the sirmµtaneous verb itself although the verb is still dependent on the final verb for specific tense/rrood desinence (see also 2.1.3.3.2.1.2.). It is ccmron for rrany clauses or sentences to be conjoined into one sentence. In a statistical count of six different texts (see 1.2.1.2.6.) there was an average of three clauses per sentence over the six texts and four of the texts had a
100

Syntax

maximum count of clauses per sentence of ten or rrore. A sample text is given below illustrating sentence coordination. In sentence 6 there are five coordinated verbs(sentences) occurring consecutively without any
intervening clausal elements. In sentence 7 there are eight coordinated sentences with one subordinated sentence. In sentence 10 there are ten coordinated. sentences with one
errbedded quote sentence. In each of these sentences all the coordinated verbs are dependent on the final verb in the sentence for tense desinence Which happens to be yesterday's past tense in rrost cases.

1.3.1.5.1: Coordination of adjectives and participial -constructions.

There is no construction equivalent to the. '-ing' and

'-ed/-en' participial adjective clauses of English. The

nearest equivalent would be where a form of the verb functions as an adjectival m:xlifier. This can be of two

types. Either (i) a verb stem suffixed by the

adjectivalizing clitic -ec/-oc or (ii) the renote past tense

form. These forms are illustrated below:

(505):&1 jo US Dl.)-eco

that house sleep lie-N:M/AllJ

'That is a sleeping house.'

(506 )Ceta tac-en.

yam store-3s-rern.p 'Stored yarn. I

But even with these forms it is not possible for them to

a:ioccur with another adjective in a a:iordinate construction

as such. However an adjectivalizing clause can a:ioccur with

an adjective as a series of postm::xlifying elements in the

noun phrase (see also 1.2.5.4.).

When sentences or clauses are OJOrdinated nonnally a

minimal reference to the subject is rraintained between

clauses by the subject person-nurrber suffixation for both

sequential and simultaneous OJOrdinate rredial verbs. In

certain circumstances, however, all reference to the subject

can be deleted with both the sequential and simultaneous

verbs. This includes ncminal and proncminal reference as

well as verbal suffixation. With the sequential rredial

verbs the subject suffixation can be optionally deleted

where the subjects are coreferential between clauses (see 2.

1. 3. 5. for details of hC1.11 the deletion operates) · With

simultaneous verbs reference to the subject by verbal

suffixation can also be deleted when subjects are

coreferential between clauses and the simultaneous verb is

functioning with a following verb expressing durative aspect

(see 2.1.3.3.2.1.11.). In this case the first clause is

ccmp::>sed of just a reduplicated verb stern with no subject

suffixation and the second (durative) verb carries the

subject person-nurrber suffixation. When a direct or

indirect object is animate a minimal reference is rraintained

between OJOrdinate coreferential clauses by verbal object

cliticization (see 2.1.3.6.2.2-3.) Other ncminal or

proncminal reference to direct or indirect object can be

anitted however. Adverbial elements of time, place, rranner,

instrurrent, cause and purpose are normally anitted where

identical in the following OJOrdinate clause. In the

examples taken frcm text below the anitted elements are

1.4. NmATICN.
Sentence negation is expressed by either a preverbal negative particle qee ·not· or ca:in ·don· t · or by negative suffixation on the verb or by both. The negative particle, qee, occurs with any past tense or the present tense or the future tense and the prohibitive particle, ca:in, occurs only with the negative .imperative rrood (negative future tense) , (see 1.1.1.3.2.). When the negative particle, qee, occurs with the present tense or the habitual past tense there is no negation narking on the verb. Any other past tense is expressed by the ooe form which is the renote past tense farm with a negative infix -1- (see 2.1.3.2.). When the negative particle qee or the prohibitive particle ca:in occurs with a verb in the future tense then the verb is . expressed in the negative future tense form which includes a negative infix -u (see 2.1.3.2~). A verb suffixed for negative future tense can optionally occur with the certain apprehensive rrood (see 2.1. 3. 4.17. ) · In this case no negative particle precedes the verb. The negative particles ·qee and ca:in are oonstituents of the verb pra-ase and can occur in aey position preceding the verb. So (a), (b) and (c) below are free variants while (d) is ungramaatical.

A second instance is in the certain apprehensive rrood

optionally be narked for future negative tense and this can

be negated by the negative particle qee 'not' · The negated

normally no negative particle precedes the verb, however the

result is negative.

1.4. 4. Coclrdinati.cn of negative clauses ~ sentences.

When negative sentences are. coordinated by coordinate

medial verb suffixation only the final verb in the clause

chain is marked for negation. The nonfinal verbs in the

clause chain are dependent upon the final verb for negation

desinence as well as tense/m:x:ld desinence. The scope of the

negation is delimited by the position of the negative

particle which occurs in the clause at the limit of the

negative scope.

3s house not go-pred.-SS-3s knife get-3s-neg.p

'He didn't go to the house and get the knife.'

In a coordinate sentence structure negative scope can also

be limited by a subordinating particle like fi 'if' or nu

'for/cause'. In this case the negation operates from the

negative particle to the subordinating conjuction.

Where sentences are coordinated by the coordinating

conjunction qa 'but' and are final dependent sentences, each

sentence mu.st be marked for negation for it to be negated.

In such cases neither the negative particle nor the negative

verbal suffixation is attracted to the coordinator or

caribined with it.

1.4. 5. Negati.cn of subordinate clauses.

It is not possible for a verb in a subordinate clause to be negated by the negation of a verb in a superordinate
clause or vice versa. A verb mu.st be negated on its own grarrmatical level. A subordinating conjunction limits the
scope of negation to the subordinated clause if the negative element qee occurs in the subordinate clause as in (536) below. Where there is a choice between negating the subordinate clause or negating the superordinate clause

Anaphora by deletion is cormon when sentences or

verbal suffixation alone. See 1. 3. 2.1. for examples from

1. 5. 1. 2. De1etia1 where el.EllE!lt is marked on the vert>.

Both subject and object can be marked on the verb (see 2.1.3.6.1.1-3.) and it is very cormon in text for all
reference to subject and object to be deleted except for verbal suffixation. Where the subject of successive coordinate clauses is coreferential even the verbal suffixation can be deleted leaving just the verb stem (see 2.1.3.5. and 2.1.3.7.). Nonnally then once a subject or object is introduced by a noun or noun phrase in the first clause it is only referenced in succeeding clauses by verbal suffixation or pronaninal reference (see 1.3.2.1-2.).

1. 5 .1. 3. Perscmal. praDlll anaPxxa·

Anaphora by personal pronoun is very cormon. In text, once a naninal reference has been made subsequent reference will be by personal pronoun or verbal suffix alone. For personal prounoun fonns see 2.1.2.1.10. Pronaninal reference can be interclausal and intraclausal. In the latter case a pronaninal "copy" is made of the preceding naninal. The pronoun itself agrees with the verb in person and nUTli:Jer and serves to emi:ttasize · the naninal or disanibiguate it from other naninals in the sentence. (541 )Imia 1q:t lD--i-a.

1. 5.1.4. Reflexive praom. ana?xxa·

There is no reflexive pronoun proper; rather reflexivity is expressed by a personal pronoun followed by a
reflexive postposition dodoc. This reflexive element follows the argurrent upon which the reflexive action of the
verb operates (see 1. 6.1.). dodoc can also function to emphasize the noun or pronoun it follows (see 1.6.9.1.).

1.5.1.5. Special aIJaihlric praDJDS·

There are no special anaphoric pronouns, however, the derronstrative pronouns i 'this' and eu 'that' can function
anaphorically either alone or in combination with other elements. Also the adverbial particles edi ' like this' and odi 'like that' and the indefinite article 060 can function anaphorically. i and eu can function alone or with personal pronouns, e.g. i age 'these' , eu age 'those' , or with the adverbials edi and odi. When functioning alone i has only a cataphoric use and eu only an anaphoric use. In combination with odi and a pronoun eu can also have a cataphoric use. In combination with a pronoun i can also have an anaphoric use. edi only has a cataphoric use and odi can function anaphorically and cataphorically. 060 only has an anaphoric
use.

1.5.1.6. Other neans of anai:hxic reference.

The switch-reference system anticipates the reference of the following subject NP and therefore has a cataphoric function (see 2.1.3.6.7.).
Another ireans of anaphoric reference exists involving special use of the first clause of the sentence Which can be just a durrrny verb or a full recapitulation clause repeating the content of the final clause of the previous sentence. It is normal in text for the subject NP of the first clause in a sentence to "pick up" its subject continuity fran the final clause of the preceding sentence either by a durrrny verb like od-oc 'to do· or by a recapitulation clause that restates the preceding final verb. So typical examples of this would be:

However, a special type of 'retrospective' reference can ~ involving the recapitulation clause. Retrospective
reference is diagrarrrned in [5] below. In this construction clause 1 of S2 is rcarked with SS following as it has an identical subject NP to clause 2 in S2· However, clause 1 of S2 is also rrarked for subject person-nunber agreement of ~ its C7Wil subject NP and in this case the subject i was previously referred to in clause 1 of S1· Clause 1 in S2 is not therefore picking up its subject continuity reference fran the llrmediately preceding clause i.e. the final clause,
2, of S1 b.lt rather is "skipping over" this clause and picking up its subject reference fran a previous, rrore distant clause. Such retrospective reference can refer back to very distant subject NP's, skipping over many clauses and even sentences as shown in example (557) below. In this construction, strictly speaking, the S/R rrarkers are only
coreferencing the following clause and therefore are functioning cataphorically, as normal, b.lt they serve to
highlight the fact that the subject reference does not
follow on frcrn the llrmediately preceding final clause and subject continuity must be related back to a rrore distant preceding clause.

head noun is replaced by the relative clause (see 1.1.2.3.).

Anaphora by deletion is optional in other cases. Anaphora
by pronoun can occur across any superordinate-subordinate

caribination except for the purpose adverbial clause (see 1.

1. 6. REFLEX[VES.

1. 6 .1. Means of expressing reflexivity.

Reflexivity is expressed by postposing the reflexive

postposition dodoc 'self' to the personal pronoun fonns (see

2.1.2.2.). These reflexive fonns function either as free

forms or as attributive within the noun phrase. A reflexive

action can also be expressed by a pronaninal clitic attached

to the verb (see 1.6. 3. ) · Also certain verbs have inherent

reflexive action where the object of the verb is identical

to the subject. Reflexive fonns can be used with tjlese

verbs, hc:JY.ever.

1.6.2. ~of reflexivity.

Ordinarily the scope of reflexivity does not extend

beyond the clause l::x:>undary since, even if the subject is not

expressed by an overt NP, subject reference is still carried

by the verb suffixation within the clause. This applies for

l::x:>th coordinate and subordinate clause structures and for

reflexivity expressed by l::x:>th the reflexive proncminal form

and the object proncminal clitic form.

1. 6. 3. Intracl.ausa1 reflexivity.

1.7. RECIPROCALS.

1. 7 .1. Means of expressing reciprocality~

Reciprocality is expressed by two cxx:>rdinate medial verbs enbedded within a matrix verb (see 2.1.3.6.9. for a
full des=iption). The two cxx:>rdinate verbs must be identical with different subject (DS) marking and third person singular subject suffixation. They can be comprised of either a verb stem plus suffixation or a third person singular object marker plus suffixation. (628 )Age :fe-oe-b fe-ce-b eig-a.

1. 7. 2. ~ of reciproca.lity.

The scope of reciprocality is not necessarily

restricted to the same clause. In nost cases the antecedent

and reciprocal element occur in the same clause as the

antecedent is marked on the reciprocal matrix verb but in

the case of the matrix verb being in the infinitive fonn the

antecedent will not be marked on the matrix verb and may

only occur in another clause.

expression of comparison can be as follows:

(i) by an equative clause expressing the standard of

comparison followed by a clause expressing the comparison

with the verb 'tll01..doc 'to surpass'. The clauses are simply

juxtaposed if the subject is the same for each clause but if

the second clause contains a different subject to the first

clause and the second clause expresses that the subject of

that clause is greater/lesser in sarre attribute to that of

the first clause then the clauses are conjoined by the

With all the neans of expressing comparison the object of comparison must be stated in the second comparative clause and this can be just a verbal clitic. If comparison
is expressed by the verb 'tll01..doc then the standard of
comparison is replaced by the verb and the object of comparison is expressed as an object of the verb. If comparison is expressed by the particles ca or 1:ahic then the standard of comparison is repeated in the
comparative clause. If comparison is expressed by antonym then the antonym replaces the standard of comparison in the comparative clause.

1. 10. POSSESSION.
The notion of possession i.e. one entity being possessed or related in a close association with another entity, is only expressed fonnally on the noun in the case of the inalienably possessed noun (see 2.1.1.4.7.). However, this notion can also be expressed in a nurrber of other ways as given below.

Alienable and inalienable possession are distinguished.

Alienable possession is expressed by a possessive noun

phrase (see 1. 2. 5.1. ) Which canpdses a possessed naninal

preceded by a possessive postpositional phrase. The

postposition is na 'of' and this can follow either a pronoun

Inalienable possession is expressed by a closed class of

inalienably possessed nouns which are mainly body parts and

kinship tenns (see 2.1.1.4. 7.1. for a full listing of known

fonns). The inalienably possessed noun is suffixed for

person and m.mber of the possessor and, in the case of the

kinship nouns, also for singular and plural nurrber of the

Topic is a pragmatic notion defined as 'What the sentence is about' (Brown and Miller 1980:376) or 'a person or thing about which something is said' (Crystal 1985:311). The topic of a sentence can therefore be distinguished on the basis of question-answer pairs like:
What about X? x is ... where X is the topic of the second sentence. Focus (Carment), on the other hand, is the essential new information corrmunicated by the sentence and can be distinguished by question-answer pairs like: What did you buy? I lx>ught X. where X is the focus of the second sentence. Focus is not dealt with here but is defined 'in order to give a clearer understanding of the notion topic.

1. 12.1. Means of indicating the ~ of ~ sentence.

In general the pragmatic category of topic coincides with the syntactic category of subject which can be clearly established and distinguished frcrn other categories by word order and verb agreement lx>th for the subject of the clause containing the rrarked verb and for the subject of the following verb (see 2.1. 3. 6. 7.). Subject normally occurs in the sentence initial position i.e. the normal syntactic p::>sition for topic. There is one type of sentence structure, however, in which the categories of topic and subject do not coincide. This is the impersonal verb structure described under 2.1.3.8. In this sentence structure two arguments occur, an experiencer and a cause, and lx>th are rrarked on the verb for person and nunber agreement. The experiencer NP is rrarked for object agreement and can be any person and nunber. The cause is rrarked for subject agreement and can only be in the third person singular. However, it is the experiencer NP (d::>ject} which must occur in the sentence initial i.e. topic, p::>sition. It is ungrarrmatical for the cause NP (subject} to
occur in this p::>sition. The impersonal verb structure is used to express psychological or physical states in respect of the experiencer. Thus in answer to a question like 'Haw

It should be noted with regard to the notion of topic

described here that the Amele topic does not rreet the

criteria laid down by Li and Thanpson (1975) for

distinguishing topic frcm subject. For example the topic in

the impersonal verb a:mstruction need not be definite:

(718 )Oso wen cb-i-a.

indef. hunger 3s-3s-tod.p

'Scmeone is hungry. '

The topic (experiencer NP) must be expressed on the verb as

a proncminal clitic. Therefore there is agreement between

the topic and the verb:

(719)*Ija wen ei-a.

ls hunger 3s-tod.p

The topic NP does not set the spatial, temp:>ral or

individual framework within which the main predicate holds.

While the topic NP rrust precede the cause (subject) NP it

does not necessarily have to occur as the first element in

the sentence:

(720)Cum

l..Ja wen te-i-an.

yesterday ls hunger ls-3s-yest.p

'Yesterday I was hungry.'

It should also be noted that, while Amele is clearly a

subject prcminent language (in Li and Thanpson' s

terminology), it does have characteristics of a topic

prominent language, viz. (i) no passive construction,

(ii) no 'durrmy' or 'empty' subjects and (iii) a double

subject using the proncminal copy strategy:

(721 )Dana i uqa 00-i-a.

man this 3s come-3s-tod.p

'This man, he came.'

Syntax

Within the impersonal verb construction only the experiencer NP can function as topic and must always precede
the cause NP.

Heavy structures, rrost cormnnly relative clauses, are nonnally rroved to the sentence initial position.

1.13. 2. Structures Which are subject to heavy shift.

The rrost com:ron type of structure that is frontshifted

is the relative clause and in fact it is preferable that

such a clause occurs as the first constituent of the

sentence (see 1.1.2.3.5.). Normally the subject NP is the

first constituent in the sentence but clauses relativizing

on the direct or indirect object can be frontshifted.

Movement of sentence constituents to the preverbal

position for erni;hasis bas been described under 1.11. and

rrovement of heavy constituents to sentence initial position

is described under 1.13. above. Movement of the relativized

element in the relative clause to clause initial position is

described under 1.1.2.3.5. Movement of conditional and

contrafactual adverbial clauses to sentence final position

is described under 1.1.2.4.2.7-8. and rrovement of the

apprehension adverbial clause to sentence initial position

is described under 1.1. 2. 4. 2.11. Another type of rrovement

process occurs which is not already described. This process

endshifts constituents to the sentence final position. The

function of this rrovement process is to express an

afterthought or, in the case of endshifted coordinate

clauses, for special stylistic effect.

1.15. MINOR SENTENCE TYPES.

Minor sentences can be of three types: (1) exclamations or response words (see 1.2.1.3.1.), (2) titles of address like proper names and kinship tenns (see 2. 1.1. 4. 7.1. ) and
(3) elliptical constructions that can occur freely in text or as answers to questions (see 1.1.1.2.4.2.).

1.16. OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR WORD CLASSES.

Word classes are defined in tenns of the following criteria: (a) rrorphology (b) distribution (c) syntactic function

1.16.1. Nam.

(a)~.

Only the inalienably possessed nouns are distinguished by

rrorphological inflection frcm other word categories.

Otherwise nouns are distinguished frcm adjectives and other

word categories on the basis of distribution.

Morphologically nouns can be divided into two basic types:

rronorrorphemic and polynorphemic. The polynorphemic nouns

can be further subdivided into reduplicated, duplicated,

derived and inflected nouns.

(i) Monarorphemic.

Most nouns are rronarorphemic i.e. are cnrnp::>sed of one

rrorpheme and cannot be inflected. Most rronarorphemic nouns

are just one or two syllables. The maximum syllable

" structure for a rronarorphemic noun is three syllables.

(ii) Polyrrorphemic.

Polynorphemic nouns can be:

(1) Reduplicated nouns.

A reduplicated noun reduplicates the first syllable of its

stem and usually only occurs in this reduplicated form.

Where the stem begins with a consonant the first CV is

reduplicated. Where the stem begins with a vowel the first

149

VC is reduplicated. Many nol.lllS are reduplicated and the

reduplication usually has a semantic basis which can be:

(A) Mass/plurality.

Duplicated nouns can be distinguished frcm reduplicated

nouns on the basis of stress placement (see 3. 3. 2.1. ) · A

reduplicated noun will carry cnly one primary word stress.

For example:

[ 1d3c:b] [Igigi.]

'tail feathers/story' I grass I

[:l'~ 'garden path'

[u'dud] 'ginger species'

A duplicated noun, en the other hand, carries primary stress

an. each element. For exanple:

['a:cs 'ais]

['f:>lo 'f:>lo]

['big 'big]

['ug 'ug]

Sane nol.lllS optionally duplicate to indicate plurality or

similarity.

(3) Derived nouns.

Nouns can be derived frcm verbs by the nan:inal.izing clitic

-ec/-oc (see 2.2.1.2.).

(4) Inflected nouns.

Inflected nouns are inalienably possessed nouns and these

are described under 2.1.1.4.7.1.

(b) D.i.strib:rticn.

A noun can occur:

(i) alone as head of the noun phrase

(ii) as head of the postnodified or prem:xlified noun

phrase

(iii) as cne of the juxtaposed items in the c:xxrq;ound or

A noun is distinguished fran an adjective or an adverb on the basis of occurrence in the circumstantial postpositional phrase (see also 2.1.1. 4. 5. ) · Only a noun can occur as object of the postposition in the circumstantial postpositional phrase. (734)Ija sigin ca.. ls knife have 'I have a knife.' (735)*Ija me ca..
ls good have *'I have good.' (736)*Ija bahl.c ca..
ls very have *'I have very.' Nouns can be subdivided on the basis of distribution: Proper nouns vs. cormon nouns.
Proper iiOOiiS" (usually names) cannot be rrodified by a noun, ari adjective, an adjective phrase, an indefinite article, a
quantifier or an emfi'l.atic word. A proper noun can also occur as the object of the postposition in the possessive postpositional phrase whereas a cormon noun cannot (see 1. 10. 2.). Camon nouns can also be subdivided into alienably vs. inalienably possessed nouns, count vs. mass(noncount) nouns and animate vs. inanimate nouns. (i) Alienably vs. inalienably possessed nouns. Alienably possessed nouns must be preceded by a possessive postpositional phrase in the prerrodified possessive noun phrase whereas inalienably possessed nouns must be preceded by either a proper noun or a pronoun (see 1. 2. 5.1. ) · (ii) Count nouns vs. nass nouns. Count nouns can be rrodified by the quantifier nedi 'rrany' whereas mass nouns can be rrodified by the quantifier geh 'much' and not vice versa. (iii) Aninate nouns vs. inanimate nouns. Aninate nouns can take a pronaninal clitic in the verb when functioning as indirect object whereas inanimate nouns cannot. (c) Syntactic :functi.cn. The noun can function as subject, direct object, indirect object, or as an adverbial of time, location or nanner in
152

Syntax
the sentence and as ncminal predicate in the equative clause.
1.16.2. Pran.m.
(a)~.
Pronouns do not inflect. (b) Distril::ut.icn. Pronouns are a closed set of items used to substitute for a noun or noun phrase. There are four basic types. (i) Personal pronouns. Personal pronouns can be free forms or pronaninal clitics attached to the verb (see 2.1.2.1. and 2.1.3.6.1.2-3.). In each case there are distinct forms for various corribinations of person and mmber. Free pronouns can occur wherever a noun or noun phrase can occur. A free pronoun must also occur before the reflexive postposition dodoc in the reflexive postpositional phrase (see 1.2.4. and 1.6.). A clitic pronoun attached to the verb must agree in person and nurrt>er with the object that it refers to. Up to two clitic pronouns can occur in the verb. (ii) Indefinite pronoun. The indefinite pronoun (see 1.2.5.2.4.) can occur as the sole head of the noun phrase or as a postrrodifier of the noun. (iii) Deictic pronouns. Deictic pronouns can be of two types:
(1) Derronstrative. Derronstrative pronouns (see 1. 2. 5. 2. 5. and 2.1. 2. 5. 2.) can occur as the sole head of the noun phrase or as a postrrodifier of the noun. (2) Locative derronstratives. Locative derronstratives (see 2.1.2.5.2.) can occur as the sole head of a locative noun phrase or as a postrrodifier of the noun. ~ (iv) Interrogative pronouns. Interrogative pronouns substitute for the questioned item (see 1.1.1.2.2. and 2.1.2.6.).
(c) Syntactic funct.icn.
The personal, indefinite, derronstrative and interrogative pronouns can have the same syntactic function as the noun or noun phrase for which they substitute. The locative derronstrative can only substitute for a locative noun phrase.
1.16. 3. Verb.
(a)~.
The verb (see 2.1. 3. ) is a word which has the potential to be inflected by a set of suffixes to indicate:
(i) predication (see 2.1.3.6.12.1.11.)
153

Syntax

(ii) tense-aspect-nood and negation of the sentence (see 2.1.3~2-4. and 2.1.3.6.12.1.10.)
(iii) person-mmber of the subject (see 2.1.3.6.1.1.) (iv7 person-mmber of the direct or indirect object (see 2.1.3.6.1.2-3.)
(v) subject coreferentiality or noncoreferentiality with the subject of the following verb (see 2.1.3.6. 7.)
In addition the verb stem, predicate marker or object marker can be reduplicated to indicate simultaneous or iterative action (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.2 and 8.). (b) Dist.ribJt:iai.
The verb selects the choice of argments in the predicate, e.g. direct or indirect object. Verbs can also be naninalized or adjectivalized by the derivational suffix
-ec/-oc (see 1.1.2.2.).
(c) Syntactic functial.
The verb predicate is the constituent of all major sentence types except the verbless equative clause and can be the minimum constituent of the sentence.

1.16.4. Adjective.

(a)~.

Adjectives do not inflect and therefore cannot be

distinguished en the basis of norphology fran alienably

possessed nouns. Adjectives, like nouns, can be

m::narorphemic or p::>lynorphemic.

(i) ~hemic. Adjectives can be nonarorphemic i.e. are carq;osed of ene

rrorpheme and cannot be inflected. Most nonarorphemic

adjectives are just ene or two syllables. The maximum

syllable structure for a nonarorphemic adjective is three

syllables.

(ii) Polyno:cphemic.

Polynorphemic adjectives can be reduplicated or derived.

(1) Reduplicated adjectives.

Reduplicated adjectives reduplicate the first syllable of

the stem. Where the stem begins with a consonant the first

CV is reduplicated. Where the stem begins with a vowel the

first VC is reduplicated.

as head of the postpositional phrase preceded by an

obligatory or optional element that fonns a ccrnpound

unit with the postposition.

sec is obligatorily preceded by a derronstrative pronoun and

the ccrnpound postpositional unit is preceded by a noun,

locative demonstrative or a noun phrase functioning as

object. The semantic function of the object is one of

direction.

hen is obligatorily preceded by a dem::>nstrative pronoun and

the ccrnpound postpositional unit is preceded by a noun,

locative derronstrative or a noun phrase functioning as

object. The semantic function of the object is one of

proximal location.

we can be optionally preceded by the word cin(ig) 'like'

fanning a ccrnpound postpositional unit with it. This can be

preceded by a noun, noun phrase or sentence functioning as

object. The semantic function of the object is that of

analogy.

(iii) Carplex postposition.

The complex postposition amdec can occur alone as a profonn

or be preceded by a noun, pronoun, adjective, noun phrase or

postpositional phrase functioning as object and the semantic

" function of the object is that of typological origin. When

amdec occurs alone it takes the syntactic function of the

constituent for Which it substitutes.

1.16.6. Nuneral/quantifier.

There is no formal distinction between nurrerals, quantifiers and nouns since any of these items can occur as the sole head of the noun phrase. A nurreral can function by
itself as subject or direct object or as a postrrodifier in the noun phrase. It can also function as an element in the
nurreral phrase {see 2. 1. 6. 1. ) · A nurreral can be postposed by an ertlfhatic word. Nurrerals also affect verb agreement.

Syntax

1.16. 7. Mvem.

Adverbs are not fonnally distinguished fran nouns or

adjectives. Items that can be detennined by other means to

be nouns or adjectives can have an adverbial function.

e.g.

(751 )Uqa jai--h nu-i-a.

3s fcot.-3s go-3s-tod.p

'He went by fcot.. '

(752)Uqa :ne nu-i-a.

3s good go-3s-tod.p

'He went well.'

(753)Uqa nalBJc nu-i-a.

3s quickly go-3s-tod.p

'He went quickly. '

Conversely 'adverbs' can have a nominal or adjectival

function viz. an adverb can function like a noun as the sole

head of the NP or like an adjective as the object of the

postposition in the a:xnprrative PP (cf. 1.2.5.1., 1.16.1.

and 1.16.4.)

e.g.

(754)Malmc nij-i-a.

quick lie-3s-tod.p

'The quick (cne) is here.'

(755 )Dana i

nalBJc.· Dana eu llElhuc ca.

man this quick man that quick add

'This man is quick. That man is quicker. '

The tenn 'adverb' is therefore naintained only for

convenience when a single item expresses an adverbial

function of the verb or clause. An adverb alone can express

the temp::>ral, locative or manner function of the clause. It

can occur in the adverbial phrase with other adverbs and can

be follOINed by an errq:hatic word in the adverbial phrase.

1. In this example there are two indirect quotes enll::>edded within a direct quote.
2. This sentence would be interpreted as 'Ho.v much food did the men eat?'.
3. This analysis follows that of Haiman (1980) and Maclbnald (1983) in descriptions of rredial verbs in Papuan languages and contrasts with the analysis of Finer (1985) for example.
4. See Downing (1978:398) for a description of replacive relative clause strategy.

naninal it follows as purpose or cause. dee marks the naninal it ·follows as source. dodoc marks the preceding pronoun as reflexive. sec with a preceding denonstrative pronoun marks the preceding naninal as the direction towards. hen with a preceding denonstrative pronoi.m marks the preceding naninal as the direction of location. we with an optional preceding particle, cin(ig) 'seem', marks the preceding ncminal as analogic or resemblance. eundec marks the preceding ncminal as social or territorial origin (see also 1.2.4. and 1.16.5.).
- - - - -2.1.1.1.s. Word order.
Word order is significant for distinguishing subject, indirect object and direct object. The basic unmarked order of constituents in the sentence is S IO 00 V. In text the order of these constituents is fairly rigid (see 1.2.1.2.6.) but novenent is possible. A direct object NP functioning as ex:periencer can occupy the sentence initial thematic(subject) position (see 1.12.) and a subject NP, which nonnally occupies the sentence initial position, can be noved to the object preverbal position for enqila.sis (see 1.11.2.1.3.). The subject, indirect object or direct object is generally expressed by a noi.m or pronoi.m but can be expressed only in the verb (see 2.1.3.6.1-3.). Since only pronouns and verbal suffixes distinguish person and nurrber a noun functioning as subject, indirect object or direct object does not agree directly with the verb, but oniy by pronaninal copy and since word order is saneWhat flexible for these constituents it rray not always be possible to determine Whether a particular naninal is functioning as subject, indirect object or direct object en syntactic criteria alone. See 1.1.2.3. (adjective clause) for an exarrple of arrbiguity.
2.1.1.1.6. Derivational processes.
The postclitic -ec/-oc can derive nouns frcm verbs
(2.2.1.2.) verbs fran nouns (2.2.2.1.) verbs frcm adjectives (2.2.2.3.) and adjectives fran verbs (2.2.3.2.). The postposition ca 'with' can derive adjectives fran nouns (see 2.2.3.1.).
2.1.1: 1. 7. Other ~ E.:l which the syntactic: and semantic
functions of ~ phrases ~ expressed.
(i) Verbal ob~ect marking. The clitic object marking on the verb can distinguish direct frcm indirect object (see 2.1.3. 6.1.2-3. ) and therefore serves to indicate both the syntactic and semantic function of the naninal to which it refers. In (1) below the object marker -ad serves to
161

M:>rphology
indicate that jo is both direct Object and plural in mmber. In (2) the object nark.er -ad is also plural but has indirect Object cnreference because of the predicate narker (see 2.1.3.6.12.1.11.). The indirect object has the semantic function of benefactive in this case.

(ii) Pronaninal ~· The naninal functioning as subject or object does not agree directly with the verb rather the optional following pronoun distinguishes person and mmber and therefore agrees with the verb. Thus person-mmber verb agreement is indicated by pronaninal copy rather than by noun inflection. (3) Drma (op) bo-i-e. man 3s a::me-3s-tcd.p 'A man came.' (4) Drma (ale) bcrsi.-e. man 3d a::me-3s-tcd.p 'Two men came. ' (5) Drma (age) bo-ig-a. man 3p a::me-3p-tcd.p 'Men came.' The pronanina1 Object clitic copied ooto the verb also serves to distinguish the nurrber of the Object NP as to whether it is either singular, dual or plural.

2.1.1. 2. Means fir ~ syntactic :functi.cms.
2.1.1.2.1. Subject of intransitive verbs.
The subject of an intransitive verb is obligatorily expressed by persoo-mmber narking suffixes in the verb (see 2.1.3.6.1.1.) Where the verb is not an infinitive form. For
162

llbrphology

the infinitive form subject persoo-nimber agreement is not

expressed in the verb (see 2.1.3.5.). The subject can also

be optionally expressed by an overt subject NP or

ooordinated NP (see 1.2.1.2.1., 1.2.5. and 1.3.1.3.). The

following examples of NP's functioning as the subject of an

intransitive verb illustrate the types of NP described in

1.2.5. viz. postnodified NP(a), prerodified NP(b), c::a!p)und

s~ubejecrt t

hat the

switch-reference system does distinguish an agentive subject

frcrn a nonagentive subject in its cnreference of the

following subject NP. The transfer of reference frcrn

Subjecti [+AGENI'] to Subjectj [-AGENT] is cnreferenced as

same subject(SS) i.e. no Change in subject/agent but the

transfer of reference frcrn Subjectj [-AGENI'] to Subjecti

[~Gm!'] is cnreferenced as different subject(DS) i.e. a

change in subject/cgent. Thus a transfer of reference

across different gramnatical subjects frcrn an agentive to a

nonagentive subject is nonnally narked as no change in

subject(agent) i.e. SS.

163

2.1.1.2.2. Subject of transitive verb.

The subject of a transitive verb is obligatorily expressed in the non-infinitive verb by the same set of person-rnmber suffixes that express the subject of an
intransitive verb. Nan:inal subjects are optional and take the same fonns as subjects of intransitive verbs (see also
1.2.1.2.1., 1.2.5. and 1.3.1.3.).

2.1.1.2.3. Subject of copu1ar construction.

A subject is obligatory in a oopular construction and can be realized by a noun phrase, by a cx:iordinated noun
phrase or by the verbal suffix. In an equational sentence the subject is obligatorily expressed by a nani.nal since there is no verb (see 1.2.1.1. and 1.2.1.1.4.).

2.1.1.2.5. Indirect object.

The category of indirect object can be distinguished fran the category of direct object by -word order and by the
way the prcncrninal object clitic attaches to the verb stem. The clitic attaches to the verb stem without an intervening predicate narker -i (see 2.1.J.6.12.1.11.) if the clitic
coreferences the direct object and attaches with an intervening predicate narker if the clitic coreferences indirect object. The syntactic indirect object category can have the semantic case functions of recipient, benefactive, malefactive, allative and ablative (see 2.1.3.6.1.2-3. for a
full description) ·

2.1.1.2.6. Object of cmpa.rison.

The object of cx:mparison is coreferenced as direct

object by the verb 11110l.-doc 'to surpass/pass' in the

cx:mparative construction (see 1.8.1.). The standard is

normally expressed first followed by the cx:mparison.

The object of equation can be narked by postpositional phiases like cin(ig) we 'seems like' :ilJoc na na
'same/similar' or ca ca 'same' (see 1.9)

Location in time can be expressed by various naninal, verbal and postpositional phrasal expressions. Also the switch-reference system has a special deictic function for indicating location in time (see 2.1. 3. 6. 7. ) · Pidgin loan words are used nonnally to describe days of the -week and
rronths of the year although there are sane Amele words for days of the week (see 2. 1.1.6. 1. 3. ) · Location in time can also be indicated by tenses an the verb (see 2.1.3.2.) i.e. present, today's past, yesterday's past, rerrote past and

2.1.1.6.1.5. Year.

The Amele are familiar with the nodenl m.mbering system

for years and the New Year is celebrated en 1st January each

year. Before the arrival of European missionaries at the

beginning of the :x>th century the yearly cycle was related

to the altematien of dry and wet seasons and the planting

of new gardens through the 11Vet sea.sen. This is reflected in

that the Amele tenn for year is cabi. ge1 ·garden fence· ·

2.1.1.6.l.6. Festivals.

None of the fonner traditional pre-Olristian cererronies are practised arry nore except occasicnally an initiatien cerenony for yoi.mg men. At this cerenony the yoi.mg men are circimci.sed during a special time of isolatien and fasting. Strangely though the Amele tenn for this cerenony is a loan
ward fran the neighbouring Gedaged (Austronesian) language.
The tenn is Jllll..ung galab. Most people OCM cnly celebrate the Christian festivals of Christnas, Easter etc.

2.1.1.6.1.1. seasons.

Being situated cnly 5° south of the equator en the northern coast of Papau New Guinea the area inhabited by the Amele is subject to the tropical m::nscx:n 11Veather pattern. Thus when the m::nscx:n winds are blowing in a southerly directien during the nonths of January to June it is the 11Vet sea.sen and when the m::nscx:n winds are blowing in a northerly directien fran July to Deceni::>er it is the dry sea.sen. The Amele have tenns for these seasons, cam sain ·sun time· and

can be narked for first, second and third perscn and
singular, dual and plural nmri:>er of the possessor and also, for the kinship nouns cnly, singular and plural nmri:>er of the possessee. othei:wise mmi:>er narking is achieved by either (i) prcnani.nal COP.f (see 2.1.1.1. 7, 2.1.2.1.1.1. and

N1mi:>er can also be distinguished When the ncmi.nal is a

direct object with the verb rreaning ·'to get/take' \lhich has

~fferent forms depending upon whether the object is singular or plural. The forms are oc (singular object) and

General quantifiers are described under 1.2.5.2.6.

2.1.1.8.4. Collective and distributive~·

(a) Collective.

Several kinship tenns (\\hl.ch can optionally be

inalienably possessed tenns) require obligatory plural

subject suffixation on the verb. These are ta1 'nuclear

family' and silu1 'clan'.

(247)Ija na tal/silu1 ene bil~ig-a.

ls of family/clan here be-3p-tod.p

'My nuclear family/clan are here.'

Other tenns that require a plural verbal agreement are am

'group/heap' and plural nouns describing people, insect or

animal groups - see belCM. Nouns describing insect or

animal groups are usually reduplicated to indicate plurality

(see 1.16.1.).

(b) Distributive. There is a special marker on the verb that can indicate
a distributive action (see 2.1.3.6.12.1.12.).
2.1.1.9. NCAlll. classes and genders.
Nouns in general are not formally divided into classes and genders. The inalienably possessed nouns (see 2.1.1. 4. 7.1.) are divided into sane 31 gramnatical classes on the basis of their first, second and third person singular suffixation. Also kinship tenns fonn a distinct class within the inalienably possessed class of nouns as they can be suffixed for plurality of the possessee. The only distinction that can be attributed to gender is the distinction between the third person singular pronaninal clitic for direct vs. indirect object (see 2.1.3.6.1.2-3.) which is -ud for direct object and -ut for indirect object. The distinction can mark the fact that an indirect object is invariably human but there is not conclusive evidence for this. The reduplicated nouns also fonn a distinct gramnatical class :Eran those nouns that cannot reduplicate (see 1.16.1.).

2.1.1.11. Marking of ;......:mmteaess in the noon pirase.

A noun phrase which has an indefinite referent is

obligatorily rrarked by either the indefinite article 090

'indefinite' or the general quantifier leih 'some' · 090 is

cnly used with count nouns and leih can be used with either

count nouns or nass nouns. As well as referring to an

indefinite referent 090 and leih can also refer to an

indefinite part of a definite referent (see 2.1.1.10 above).

090 and leih can function alone as subject, direct or

indirect object or as an attributive element within the NP

2.1.1.12-14. Millking of refeEential.ity, generimess and .inprtance of actor:s.

The rrarking of referential vs. nonreferential indefiniteness does not occur. Neither is genericness
rrarked in the NP. Noun actors that are rrore inp:>rtant than other noun acto;rs can be distinguished by special use of the switch-reference system (see 2.1.3.6. 7.). In effect the S/R system can distinguish a subject NP that is [+AGENI'] frcm cne that is [-AGENI'].

is ccmronly known as 'pronaninal cov.r' · The purpose of this pronaninal cov.r is (i) to give focus to the naninal referred
to by the pronoun, (ii) to clarify the person and mmber of the referents Where this is not clear fran the naninal
itself or (iii) to provide verbal agreement for the naninal.
Any of the free pronouns can occur as the copying pronO\.lll. (283)Bunag up bo-i-a..

2.1.2.1.18.1. PronO\.lll groupings·

It is possible for t1rlO or rrore pronouns to occur in a
coordinated structure with this also being optionally copied by a following pronoun. AIT:f cxrtibination of pronO\.lll can occur in the coordinated structure. The hierarchy for choice is 1st> 2rrl > 3rd (cf. a,lso 2.1.1.4.4.). The choice of the following copying pronoun is dependant upon Whether
there is a first, second or third person pronoun in the
coordinate structure. If there is a first person pronoun in the coordinate structure then the copying pronoun will be first person also. If there is a second person pronoun in the coordinate structure and no first person pronoun then the copying pronOWl will be second person also. otherwise the copying pronoun is third person. This is illustrated in
table 2. 3 below.

Reflexive pronouns are fanned by postposing the particle dodoc 'self' to the free pronoun fonns (see 2.1.2. 1.10.). The resulting fonns function as rrodifier of subject, direct Object, rrodifier of direct object, rrodifier of indirect object, adpositional indirect object, rrodifier of adpositional indirect object, element in adpositional phrase and rrodifier of element in adpositional phrase (see also 1.6.).

A distinction is made on the basis of alienable vs.

inalienable possession. Alienable possession is indicated

by a free pronoun or noun followed by the postposition na

'of' · Inalienable possession is indicated by a closed set

of inalienably possessed nouns (see 1.10.2.4. and 2.1.1.4.7.

possessive postpositional phrase as part of the possessed

noun phrase (see 1. 2. 5. ) and is not itself marked for

possession. An inalienably possessed noun is preceded by a

noun or free pronoun and is marked itself for possessedness.

No other types of possession are distinguished.

218

Morphology

3-4 and 1.1. 2. 3. 7. ) , hol..ever, sane informants, influenced no

doubt by English, suggest that the interrogative pronoun

in 'Who' can be used in Amele in a similar way to the

relative pronoun 'Who' in English. So sane English

educated Amele ~ers would say that (324) and (325) for

example are grarrmatical sentences in Alrele.

(324)Mel in mela:id qo-i-a

ija f-ig-a.

ls see-ls-tod.p

'I saw the ooy Who stole the chicken. '

With this data, hol..ever, one is forced to question the

linguistic competence of these informants. Older nonEnglish

educated Amele speakers have difficulty in processing

sentences like (324) and (325) and to make any sense of them

m::rlify them to give the indefinite reading.

ls see-ls-tod.p

'I saw Whoever stole the chicken. '

Also there is no instance of the pronoun in occurring as a

relative pronoun in any of the text material recorded by the

author. This text material a::imprises sane 32 different

texts totalling 15, 500 words and was given by a wide range

of informants l::oth different ages and sex. On the basis of

this evidence then the conclusion is drawn that in does not

function naturally in Amele as a relative pronoun but could

be being introduced by sane bilingual Alrele-English

speakers.

2.1. 2. 7.1.1-5. Marking of relative pronouns.

2.1.3. Verl:> ~logy.
2.1. 3.1. Voice.
2.1.3.1.1. Passive.
There is no passive voice but a pseudo-passive i.e. a means of suppressing the subject, can occur by simply emitting the subject (see 2.1.3.1.2). Another means of suppressing the subject is with the impersonal verb C'Ol'lstruction (see 2.1.3.8.).
2.1. 3.1. 2. Means of decreasing the valency of ~ verb.
The emission of the agent/subject NP from a clause with an agentive verb results in a pseudo-passive. The subject is suppressed and the object is prooot.ed to Topic i.e. occurs in sentence initial position. So a transitive verb becomes an apparent intransitive verb. (328)Ija. na qet-ig-a..

' This process of valency reduction is not a true passive transformation, hc:Jl.l.ever, but merely a suppression of subject. In equivalent sentences with a plural object or a verb that requires a plural object the verb does not take plural subject narking when the subject is suppressed and in fact the plural object narking is maintained either through object cliticization or through the plurality of the verb.

2. 1. 3. 1. 3.1. Causative verbs.

There is no fonnal distinction between causative and

noncausative verbs but a causative notion can be expressed

by a series of sequential verbs where the first verb in the

sequence expresses the causal action. Usually the verb

od-oc 'to do' is the first verb in the sequence although

other verbs can have this function. The same causative

construction applies to intransitive, transitive and

ditransitive verbs.

2.1.3.1.3.2. Agentivity of the~·

There is no fonnal difference depending on the agentivity of the causee. J:Io..vever in the impersonal verb
construction where the subject NP expressing cause is coreferenced by the switch-reference system it indicates that this particular type of cause is nonagentive (see 2.1. 3.6.7.).

2.1.3.1.4. Special reflexive and reciprocal verb fonns.

There are no special reflexive verb fonns. There are special reciprocal verb fonns (see 2.1.3.6.9. for a full
description) ·

2.1. 3. 2. Tense.

Tense is described in tenns of Comrie's definition

(Comrie 1985:130):

tense E(relative R)n (relative S)

rragn

rragn

and is one of eight categories rrarked by verb3.l suffix; the

others are: subject person-nurrber agreement, direct and

indirect object person-nurrber agreement, aspect, rrood,

negation and subject coreferentiality with the subject of

the following clause. In addition there is a verb3.l element

analyzed as a predicate rrarker which can be suffixed to the

verb stem in certain conjugations (see 2.1.3.6.12.Lll.).

There are also rrarkers that can indicate distributive or

exclusive action (see 2.1.3.6.12.1.12-13.). The rerrote past

tense and negative past tense fonns catibine lx:>th subject

person-nurrber agreement and tense rrarking. The negative

future tense corrt>ines subject person-nunber agreement, tense

and negation rrarking. These fonns and the past tense fonns

are treated as portrrant(.>a.U rrorphemes. The following

catibinations of tense and aspect occur (i.e. they are

rranifested by the same rrarking on the verb) : present tense +

progressive aspect, today's past tense+ perfect aspect, and

habitual past tense + habitual aspect. In the last

caribinationthere is a habitual aspect rrarker together with

distinctive habitual past tense subject agreement rrarkers.

All tenses except the relative future tense are absolute

i.e. they all have the fonnal specification E relative S

(Comrie 1985).

Paradigms are given below for the verbs f-ec 'to see'

and h-oc 'to come' for the nine tenses; present, today' s

Future tense.

The marking of future tense, E after S, is nore ccmplex than

the rrarking for the other tenses and while sane processes

can be postulated for deriving surface fonns frcm underlying

fonns it is probably best to treat the whole future tense

and subject person-nurrber agreement marking as a comrosite

portrranteau norpheme. What can be observed frcm the surface

fonns would suggest that the underlying norpheme for future

tense is -an. This is the surface fonn in all the

~conjugations except the first person singular where it is

-en. This ananaly can be explained by the fact that the

stem final VO'Wel, [], in the first person dual and plural

fonns for verbs like £-ec does not undergo rounding before
the labio-velar phonemes /w/ and /cp/ as in the other tenses

where this sequence oc=s. Thus in the first person dual

and plural fonns there is a rule in the norphology that

blocks assimilation of [S] to [o] across a norpheme ooundary

preceding labio-velars. The quality of this VO'Wel is in

fact a word final phonetic quality of [e]. It would

therefore be reasonable to assUIIE that the appearance of [S]

in the first person singular future fonn is related to the

rule in the dual and plural derivations, h.o..ever, how this

relates exactly is difficult to explain. The future tense

is also marked by a particular class of subject

person-nurrber agreement markers, class 3. It can be seen

225

Morphology

that the third person singular fonn -ig:i is a

caribination of the class 1 first person singular fonn -ig

and third person singular fonn -i. Also the dual and plural

second/third person fonns -was and -qag appear to be

caribinations of the class 1 dual and plural first person and

second/third person fonns -w + -si and -q + -g:i respectively

but again clear derivations are not analyzable so the fu~ure

fonns are treated as a separate class of subJect

person-nurcber agreement narkers, class 3. (see also 3.4.

(ItDrphophonology)).

Relative future tense.

The relative future tense, E after R, expresses the notion

of an action about to take place i.e. an intention or a

Negative future tense, not(E after S), is narked in a

boundary is not blocked in the first person dual and plural

fonns neither does [E] oc= in the first person singular

form of the future tense narker, and (iii) the second/third

person dual and plural fonns are idiosyncratic to the

ls garden to go-ls-pres. 'I am going(irrmediately) to the garden.'
The present tense fonn is often used in narrative text to
relate events in past time and in this way the focus is on the progressive aspect of the present tense (see 2.1. 3. 3. 2. 1.5.).

2.1.3.2.1.3. Past tense.

2.1. 3. 2.1. 3.1. Degrees of rerroteness of ~ tense.

There are four sets of fonns which indicate that a situation relates to past time: ~ (i) The tDday's past tense describes an event that has occurred on the same day of the utterance. The perfect aspect is inherent to the today's past tense (see 2.1. 3. 3. 1.), i.e. it indicates the =ntinuing present relevance of a past situation (Canrie 1976: 52). The tense is narked on the
verb by the ItDrpheme -a. The today's past tense fonn is also used to indicate the irnperative rrood (see 1. 1.1. 3. ) · (359 )Ija hu-g-a.

(360)Ija dana. eu fi-g-a. ls Irl3Il that see-ls-tod.p 'I saw that rran(today)/ I have seen that ffi3Il.'
(ii) The yesterday's past:. tense describes an event that has occurred on the day previous to the day of the utterance and is narked on the verb by the suffix -an.

(362)Ija dana eu fi-g-an. ls rnan that see-ls-yest.p 'I saw that rnan (yesterday) · '
(iii) The renDte past tense describes an event that has occurred at least two days previous to the day of the utterance. It is marked on the verb by the class 6 tense and subject person-nurrber portrranteau rrorphemes. The rerrote past tense is one of the wain tense fonns used for relating events that have occurred in past ti.Ire. The others are the past habitual tense and the present (progressive) tense. (363 )Ija ho-cm.
ls corne-ls-rem.p 'I came.' (364)Ija dana eu fe-em. ls rnan that see-ls-rem.p ' I saw that rnan. ' (iv) The habi.:bJal. past tense describes an event that has occurred continuously in past ti.Ire sane ti.Ire previous to the ti.Ire of the utterance. It is rrarked on the verb by the class 1 subject person-nurrber markers occurring verb finally. A past habitual verb is also marked by the past habitual aspect marker -lo. The past habitual is one of the main tenses used to describe events in the past. The others are the rerrote past and the present (progressive) tense. (365 )Ija ho-1-ig ls a:::mie-hab.p-1 s 'I used to. came.' (366}Ija dana eu fb-1-ig. ls man that see-hab.p-ls 'I used to see that man.' With the today, yesterday and rerrote past tenses there are cooccurrence restrictions with temporal expressions. So an expression for 'today' can only cooccur with the today's past tense, an expression for 'yesterday' can only cooccur with the yesterday's past tense and neither of these expressions can cooccur with the rerrote past tense. Although the today's past tense has this lexical cooccurrence restriction it can be used to describe an event that covers a period of ti.Ire fran the distant past up to the present rranent. In this way it manifests the notion of perfect aspect (see 2.1.3.3.1.). With regard to the differing degrees of rerroteness in the past tenses between today's past, yesterday's past and the rerrote past tense it is interesting to note that the changeover fran one past tense to another is not rigid. A change fran the yesterday's past tense to the today's past tense does not occur on the stroke of midnight for example. Generally any event that occurred in the hours of darkness
228

Morphology

the previous night can be referred back to either in the yesterday' s past tense or in the today' s past tense
depending on whether the speaker considers the event relates to other events that occurred on the previous day or to events that have occurred on the same day as the utterance subsequent to the event in question. The same principles apply to the changeover fran the rerrote past tense to the yesterday's past tense.

2.1.3.2.1.3.2. Relative tenses in the~·

All past tenses are absolute i.e. relative only to the

ti.Ire of the utterance, but notions like past-in-the-past or

future-in-the-past can be realized with quotes, either

direct or indirect:

2.1.3.2.1.4. Future tense.

Future tense can be absolute (future tense proper) or

relative (relative future tense).

future ti.Ire and is marked on the verb by the verb final

4 suffix -an/-en.

2.1.3.2.1.4.1. Modal and aspectual values of the future forms.

The nodal value of the absolute future tense is

indicative and the inherent aspectual value is perfective,

i.e. the situation is viewed in its entirety as a cx:rnplete

whole (Cetnrie 1976: 18) · The nodal value of the relative

future tense is oonditional and the inherent aspectual value

is imperfective as its normal use is to express a notion of

purpose or intention in relation to another action (see 1.

1.2.4.2.5.). A relative future action is therefore usually

incx:rnplete on its ONn (Crystal 1985: 153). The imperative,

supplicative, intentional, permissive, hortatory, rronitory,

apprehensive (certain and probable) and prescriptive rroods

all relate to future tine (see 2.1.3.4.). The negative

future form is used to 'express the negative imperative

(prohibitive) rrood and can be used to express the certain

apprehensive rrood without the rrood particle dain 'lest' (see

also 1.1.1.3.2. and 2.1.3.4.17.).

2.1.3.2.1.4.2. Degrees of rerroteness in the future tense.

The absolute future tense is not subdivided acoording to rerroteness of future events. The relative future tense is used to describe an event that is about to happen in the near future but it does not oorrelate with teinp:>ral expressions as the past tenses do (cf. 2.1.3.2.1.3.1.).

2.1.3.2.1.4.3. Relative tenses in the future.

The relative future tense is described under 2.1.3.2. and 2.1.3.2.1.4. The notion of future-in-the-future can be expressed by corril::>ining the relative future tense with the absolute future tense.

The full range of tense forms can apply to any rrood

with the following restrictions:

(vii) Verbs rnarked for the prescriptive or oontrafactual

considered nonfinite forms.

Infinitive forms are not rnarked for tense/aspect/rrood as

such although some rroods require the infinitive form of the

verb. The nonfinite medial verbs are not rnarked for tense

and are dependent on the final finite verb in the sentence

for tense desinence. However they can be marked for

perfective, imperfective or iterative aspect and the

perfective aspect SS verb can also be marked for oonditional

rrood.

Certain aspectual values are inherent to certain tense

forms: Progressive aspect is inherent to the present tense.

tense to express the notion of future-in-the-future (see 2.1.3.2.1.4.3.). The nonfinite medial verbs in a coordinate serial clause chain are dependent on the final finite verb in the chain for tense desinence (see 1.3.1.1.4., 2.1.3.3.2. 1.1-2. and 2.1. 3. 7. ) · Also the medial verbs expressing simultaneous action with different subject marking have different fonns for nonfuture(realis) vs. future(irrealis) tense (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.2.).
2.1.3.3. Aspect.
Aspect is a category marked on the verb and is defined as different ways of viewing the internal temp:>ral constituency of a situation (O::rnrie 1976: 3) · Aspect is marked fo:anally on the verb only in the following cases: (i) perfective aspect (sequential action) , (ii) imperfective aspect (sirnultaneous action) , (iii) habitual aspect (past habitual action) and (iv) iterative aspect (repetitive action). Apart from this different kinds of aspectual meaning can be expressed lexically by the use of: (i) auxiliary verbs like bi1-ec 'to sit/be', nij-ec 'to lie/be', he-dx: 'to finish', cit qoc 'to tenninate', cu1-ec ' to leave' , cuha-doc 'to excel' functioning in a paratactic sequence with a preceding verbv.ihich they rrodify (see also 2.1.3.7.), or as an independent verb, (ii) adverbials like wel.e 'already', gaid 'al'l'ays'. Aspect can be marked on the verb by either (i) an aspectual marker (ii) reduplication or repetition of the verb stem or (iii) aspect can be integral to the particular tense e.g. perfect aspect is integral to the today's past tense and progressive aspect is integral to the present tense.
2.1.3.3.1. Perfect~·
The perfect forms have both aspectual (present result of past event) and temp:>ral (today's past) semantic values. The perfect aspect expresses the continuing relevance of a previous situation (O::rnrie 1976:56).
2.1.3.3.1.1. Perfect~ fo:nns.
The notion of perfect aspect can be expressed by either an adverb, wel.e 'already' preceding the verb or by the existential verbs bi1-ec 'to sit/be' or nij-ec 'to lie/be' v.ihich have a perfect aspectual function when conjugated in the today's past tense. (378)Uqa wel.e nu-i-a..

Perfective (aorist) aspect i.e. a situation that is

a single punctual event viewed in its totality, without

distinguishing beginning, middle and end, is expressed by

the sequential action medial verb. The sequential action

verb indicates a ternp::>ral succession of cnnsecutive events.

It cannot be used to describe events that are not in linear

sequence. So (394) belCM is ungrarrmatical. Finite verbs

must be used do describe these events as in (395).

Sequential action (perfective aspect) is not marked

overtly on the verb as with simultaneous action

(imperfective aspect) but rather there are overt markers to

indicate that the subject of the following verb is 'same' or

'different' subject to the subject of the marked verb (see

2.1. 3. 6. 7. ) · The markers are -ne for SS following and -cN
for rs following where v stands for a hanronic \IO'J\el in the

rs narker. In addition sequential verbs marked for SS or rs

following each have distinct sets of subject person/nurrber

agreement markers and these cnrrespond with the SS and IE

sets employed by the simultaneous verbs. Specifically

sequential SS markers cnrrespond with simultaneous SS

markers, and sequential DS markers cnrrespond with irrealis

simultaneous rs markers. The SS marker on the sequential

verb can be deleted in cnntext producing a so-called

' stripped aov.m.' verb (see 2.1. 3. 5. ) · Such a verb a:impdses

a verb stem followed optionally by a direct object marker

followed by the predicate marker -i. The stripped dov.n SS

verb rrost often occurs in a paratactic a:instruction

preceding another verb (see 2.1.3. 7.) and the SS deletion is

obligatory in these fonns but the deletion can also occur on

a single verb in the clause when such a clause is part of a

clause chain. It would appear that this SS marking deletion

is a kind of cnntraction similar to that which occurs in

English in verb phrases like 'don't' or ''WOil' t' ·

Verbs marked for sequential action therefore a:intrast

with simultaneous verbs in that where simultaneous verbs are

marked overtly for simultaneous action by reduplication,

sequential verbs are marked cnvertly for sequential action

by the fact that they are not marked by reduplication for

simultaneous action, and cnrrespondingly, where sequential

236

Morphology

verbs carry overt SS and rs markers, same subject and

different subject following is marked cnvertly on the

simultaneous verbs by the set of subject person/nurrber

agreement markers employed. An alternative analysis would

be to say that SS or DS is marked covertly in l:x:>th

sequential and simultaneous verbs by the sets of subject

person/nurrber agreement markers employed in each case and

that the so-called SS and IE markers on the sequential verbs

in fact mark sequential action. However this analysis has

nothing to a:mnend it apart from the prospect of giving to

1:x:>th simultaneous and sequential verbs the possibility of

overt aspectual marking. Also if such an analysis were

cnrrect it would be expected that the marker on the

sequential verb would be the same for l:x:>th SS and IE (Which

it is not) and that SS and rs a:>reference would be

maintained entirely by the set of subject person/nurrber

agreement markers. This is not the case.

As with the simultaneous verbs sequential verbs are

dependent on the final verb in the sentence for tense/rrood

desinence. For the sequential verbs this is a total

dependence. The tense/rrood designated on the final verb

thus applies to the whole coordinate medial verb chain in

the sentence (see also 1. 3.1.1.4.).

The sequential verb can also be marked for other types

of aspectual category either functioning itself as the final

verb in a paratactic series and expressing the categories of

a:xnpletive, resultative and durative aspect, or it can carry

inherent aspectual rreaning expressing ingressive, a:>nclusive

or discontinuative aspect, or it can be marked by some form

of reduplication indicating iterative aspect. other notions

of perfectivity can be expressed by the iterative aspect.

Exemplary paradigms for sequential SS and IE are given belCM

for the verbs f-ec 'to see' and h-oc 'to aJme' · The
stripped aov.m. SS forms for these verbs would be f-i and h-u

in each case. (see 3. 4. Morphophonology for further

explanation on the derivation of these forms.)

2.1.3.3.2.1.2. Inperfective ~·

Imperfective aspect i.e. explicit reference to the internal temp:::>ral structure of a situation, viewing a
situation frcm within (Comrie 1976:24), is expressed by the simultaneous action rredial verb. Simultaneous action indicates a temp:::>ral overlap of concurrent events and
normally a simultaneous verb is followed by a nonsimultaneous verb although occasionally in text two simultaneous verbs can occur in linear sequence (see (410) below). The occurrence of a simultaneous verb indicates a
temp:::>ral overlap of events with the event described by the following verb except, of course, where the following verb is in a paratactic construction with the simultaneous verb

238

Morphology

and carries itself sane aspectual value such as completive,

resultative or durative aspect. In such cases the

simultaneity carries forward to the verb following the

paratactic construction (see example (407) below).

Simultaneous action is marked on the verb by (i) sane

form of reduplication of the verb (see below for the various

verb classes described according to the type of

reduplication employed) and also (ii) particular forms of

subject person/nunber agreement markers which, as well as

marking simultaneity, also mark anticipatory coreference

with the subject of the following verb in the serial clause

chain (see 2.1.3.6.7.).

The simultaneous verb can also be marked lexically for

other categories of aspectual value like ingressive,

ccmpletive, conclusive, discontinuative and resultative

aspect; hov.ever, like the sequential action verb, the

simultaneous verb is dependent on the final verb in the

clause chain (i.e. the final verb in the sentence) for

tense/rrood desinence. With the sequential action verb this

dependence is total but with the simultaneous action verb

the dependence is only partial. As mentioned previously the

simultaneous action verb also coreferences the subject of

the following verb as 'same' or 'different' as part of the

switch-reference system (see 2.1.3.6.7.). With the verbs

marked for same subject following the dependence on the

sentence final verb for tense/rrood desinence is total but

with the verbs marked for different subject following there

are two sets of subject agreement markers. One set occurs

when the tense/rrood of the final verb refers to a real

situation (realis) and the other set occurs when the

tense/rrood of the final verb refers to an unreal situation

(irrealis) · The realis set occurs when the final verb is in

any past tense or the present tense and the irrealis set

occurs when the final verb is in the future tense or

irrperative or contrafactual rrood. So the following

' sentences apply.

Thus with simultaneous verbs anticipatory subject

a:>reference is not narked overtly as with the sequential

action verbs but rather same or different subject following

is determined by the class of subject person/mmber narkers

used. The class of subject person/mmber agreement narkers

indicating SS following for the simultaneous verb

a:>rresponds with the same class of narkers used for

indicating SS following in the sequential action verb. The

class of subject person/mmber agreement narkers indicating

rs following in the irrealis simultaneous action verb

a:>rresponds with the class of narkers indicating DS

following in the sequential action verb. Exemplary

~ology

Verbs can be classified according to how they reduplicate to

express simultaneous action. There are five different ways

for the verb to reduplicate and only one strategy is

normally employed by any particular verb although sane verbs

can employ strategy (3), object reduplication, as well as

one of the other strategies:

(1) by reduplication of the first syllable i.e. (C)V of the

verb stem.

(2) by reduplication i.e. lengthening, of the first 'll'Olflel of

the subject person/nunber agreement rrarker.

(3) by reduplication of the object rrarker in the verb.

(4) by repetition of the whole verb stem.

(5) by reduplication of sane internal part of the verb stem.

In the following lists of verbs classified according to

reduplication strategies all the verbs are conjugated in the

realis simultaneous action with third person singular

subject agreement.

(3) Verbs that reduplicate the object rrarker.

Any verb that oontains an ooject rrarker will reduplicate the

object rrarker so no special listing has been made of this

type of verb. Hat.lever reduplication of the object rrarker is

slightly different, mainly in the second/third person dml

and plural fonns, according to whether the ooject

aoreferenced is direct or indirect, as the following

paradigms illustrate. sab rreans 'fcxx1' , mn-ec rreans 'to

oook' , cam rreans 'SWl' and oc rreans 'to get' · The

(5) Verbs tllat reduplicate stem internally.

.

Sane of these verbs (set (aTfare known to have comp:>site

verb stems. For example ahoc is a a:xcil:>ination of oc 'get'

and h.Jc 'a:me' · The verbs beginning with ehi- are a

comp:>site of 'get' , 'cane' and then a direction verb, 1ec

'go' I tee 'go up' I bee 'a:me up' I nee 'go down' I nee 'cane

down' · With these verbs reduplication occurs on the final

verb stem in the =np::>site verb. With the verbs in set (b)

it is not clear as to whether they have comp:>site verb stems

or not to account for the stem internal reduplication.

As mentioned previously the simultaneous verb can a:xcil:>ine

with other verbs in a paratactic serial verb construction

which expresses other categories of aspectual value

viz. completive, resultative and durative aspect. In these

cases the final verb in the paratactic sequence carries the

simultaneous suffixation. Examples of such a:xcil:>inations are

given below.

Other notions of imperfectivity can be expressed by the

categories of aspect described below i.e. habitual,

progressive, tenninative,

completive,

conclusive,

discontinuative, resultative and durative aspect (see 2.1. 3.

3. 2.1. 3-11.).

2.1.3.3.2.1.3. Habitual~·

The habitual aspect, which describes a situation tllat

is characteristic of an extended period of time (Canrie

1976: 27 ) , can be marked in two ways:

(1) Morphologically by the past habitual verb suffix - lo

'habitual' which follows the verb stem and precedes the

subject person/nurrber suffix. See the illustrative paradigm

of the verb nu-ec 'to go' bela..v. The past habitual aspect

is most ccmronly used in historical narrative text of a

procedural nature and quite often all the final verbs in

such texts will carry past habitual aspect. Alternatively

the present (progressive) tense can be used to relate

durative events tllat occurred in past time (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.

5.).

(414)Wele ca ege Hilu bilo--1.o-b.

Before add lp

be-hab.p-lp

'Before we used to live in Hilu.'

(2) Lexically by the adverb gaid 'always' · This can occur

with the present or future tenses or with the habitual past

tense itself.

(415)Uqa gaid nu-i-na.

3s always go-3s-pres.

'He always goes.'

(417)Uqa gaid nt:D-lo-i. 3s. allM:lys go-hab.p-3s 'He al\\e.ys used to go.'
Note also that a present habitual action can be expressed by the rrood particle ml (see 2.1.3.4.18.).

2.1.3.3.2.1.5. Progressive~·

There is no fonnal way of marking progressive aspect on the verb but such aspectual meaning is inherent in the present (progressive) tense. The progressive aspect is defined in tenns of a caroination of progressive(continuous) meaning and nonstative meaning (Ccmrie 1976: 35) · Consequently when the verb bi..1-ec 'to be/sit' is used as a stative verb it is unacceptable for it to be in the present tense (cf. 2.1.3.3.1.1. - perfect aspect.). (418)?Naus bi..1-i-na fo?
be-3s-pres. QU (With the intended meaning of 'Is Naus here?') What this sentence actually means is saaething like 'Is Naus continuously present?' or 'Is Naus continuously sitting?'
The present (progressive) tense is used to relate events that have occurred in past tine in texts of a historical or procedural nature. Several texts (15 and 16) are related
aln'Ost entirely in the present tense even though the speaker is describing events that occurred many years ago in his youth.

2.1.3.3.2.1.6. Ingressive ~·

There is no fonnal means of expressing the beginning of

a situation but this meaning can be achieved by use of the

cx:mr:ound verb phrase sanan m-ec 'to begin' or the verb m-ec

I to put/beca:neI ·

furphology

2.1.3.3.2.1.7. Tenninative ~·

There is no fonnal means of expressing the end of a situation but this can be achieved lexically either by the

use of various paratactic serial verbs (see 2.1.3.7.) like

he-doc 'to finish' and ~ 'to excel' or various verbal

expressions like cit q-oc 'to conclude' (lit: 'to sharpen to a p:iint' ) and cu1-ec 'to leave' ·

(1) Carpletive ~· The canpletive aspect has the notion that a situation is finished or canpleted and is expressed

by the verb he-doc 'to finish/canplete' 'Ahl.ch can function

either on its C1N!1 or as the second verbal element in a

paratactic series of serial verbs. In this second

construction the verb he-doc gives a canpletive meaning to

the situation expressed by the first verb and also carries

any subject agreement and tense/aspect/rrood verbal suffixes. The first verb is only marked by the predicate marker.

There are no special fonns to indicate the carpletion of another situaticn prior to the situation being described
but it is very a::mron in extended discourse to nak7 u~e of
the switch-reference system (see 2.1.3.6.7.) to indicate
that a particular series of related events are completed.and that scmething new is to be introdu:::ed into the narrc;ttive.
In narrative a recapitulation clause often begJ.nS a
sentence and basically expresses again the content of the final clause of the previous sentence· The recapitulation, clause can be an exact repeat of the lexical items used in the previous final clause or, nore
a::mionly, a dumny verb like oci-oc 'to do' or he-doc. 'to finish· are employed. Such a dumny verb can occur lll a
stereotype form ocb-oo--b 'he <;lid it -rs' or l~
'he finished it -rs· and in this way bas the special
function to indicate an episodic carpletion of events or that scmething new is to be introdooed. When
functioning this way the dumny verb alw:tys occurs with

250

M::>rphology

third perscn singular subject agreement regardless of

the subject agreement of the verb in the final clause of

the preceding sentence. Where a recapitulation clause is

not indicating the carpletion of an episode it will "pick

up" the same subject' agreement of the final verb in the

preceding sentence. This is illustrated in (430) and (431)

below.

The tmderlined items

constitute the

recapitulation clause in each case. Exanples of episodic

completion are given in (432), (433) and (434) · The

tmderlined items indicate episodic carpletion in each case.

2.1.3.3.2.1.8. Iterative~·

Iterative aspect describes the successive occurrence of several instances of the same situation and is to be distinguished frcm habitual aspect which describes a situation that is characteristic of an extended period of time (Ccmrie 1976: 27) · In Amele iterative aspect can be marked on the verb as a distinct category separate frcm l:oth habitual and imperfective (simultaneous action) aspect. Iterative aspect can be marked on the verb by reduplication of some part of the verb, i.e. the verb stern itself or the object marker, if present, or the predicate marker. The reduplication differs frcm the reduplication involved in the simultaneous action verb in two ways: (i) the verb stern can be reduplicated rrore than once. In
one instance in text a verb stern is reduplicated three tirnes and theoretically reduplication can be continued
indefinitely to describe an iterative action. (ii) the subject agreement suffixes are not those for the simultaneous action verb, rather any other subject agreement
suffixes and tense/aspect/rrood markers can be affixed to the verb.
In fact it is possible to caril::>ine iterative aspect with other aspects, tenses and rroods as illustrated below:

2.1.3.3.2.1.9-10. Semelfactive and Punctual~·

There is no special way of expressing the notions of semelfactive or punctual aspect in the language.

2.1.3.3.2.1.11. Durative ~·

The durative aspect is reali~ed l~xical~J[by 1 use <;>f on~ of the stative verbs bi.1-ec 'to sit/be or ni~ to 17e/be

functioning as the final verb in a paratact7c series <;>f

serial verbs. In such a construction the preceding verb is

marked only by the predicate marker, -i, (see ~.1.3.6.12:1·

ll. ) and expresses the situation While the final stative

verb carries the verbal suffixation for tense/aspect/m:xxl

etc. The preceding non-stative verb can also be

reduplicated in some way to expre~s iterative action (see 2.

1.3.3.2.1.8.) or simultaneous aetion (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.2.?·

In either case it can be some part of the.verb stem that.is

reduplicated or the object marker. For simultaneous action

the stative verb can also be optionally reduplicate<;I as well

as the verb expressing the situation. A st..;itive .verb

expressing durative aspect rrost comronly fun~ions ~th a

simultaneous action verb but can also function with a

nonsimultaneous action verb. The paradigms below il~ustrat~

Mood is a category marked an the verb and is defined by Crystal (1985:198) as a set of syntactic/semantic oontrasts , signalled by alternative paradigms of the verb. These semantic oontrasts can have a wide range including uncertainty, definiteness, vagueness, possibility, etc. Rescher (1968) defines the following eight types as oonceptual domains of rrodality: (1) Alethic rrodalities, relating to the notion of truth itself. (2) Epistemic rrodalities, relating to knowledge and belief. (3) Temporal rrodalities, relating to time. (4) Boulomaic rrodalities, relating to desire. (5) Deontic rrodalities, relating to duties. · (6) Evaluative rrodalities. (7) Causal rrodalities. (8) Likelihood rrodalities ·
In Amele nood. is a syntactic and semantic category expressing a wide range of meaning an the part of the speaker such as supplication, oonditionality, pennissian, emphasis, desire, doubt, apprehension, oontrafactuality and

regret. Only four of these rroods; imperative, conditional,

prescriptive and contrafactual can be narked norphologically

on the verb. Most categories of rrood are realized by a

particular rrood particle postposed to the sentence. The

interrogative rrood can be expressed either by a postposed

particle for yes-no questions or by a question word. There

are seventeen categories of rrood. Of these thirteen are

expressed norphologically by a rrood particle postposed to

the sentence. These are:

2.1.3.4.1. Indicative rrood.
A verb in the indicative rrood rrak:es a statement and is the unmarked rrood. There are nine tense paradigms in the indicative rrood: present, today's past, yesterday's past, rerrote past, habitual past, negative past, future, relative future and negative future (see 2. 1. 3. 2. ) ·

2.1.3.4.2. Interrogative rrood.

The interrogative rrood expressing a yes-no question is

realized by the interrogative rrood particle :fo postposed to

the sentence. The interrogative rrood can also be realized

by a question-word (see also 1. 1.1. 2.1-2. ) ·

overtones of pleading or supplication and is realized by the

supplicative rrood particle no postposed to the sentence.

2. 1. 3.4. 4. Conditional rrood.

The conditional rrood expresses a hypothetical situation

in present or future tine and is realized by the conditional

rrood particle fi 'if' occurring clause finally. Where the

conditional rrood occurs on a nonfil1al clause it is required

that the clause final verb be narked for perfective aspect

(sequential action). Imperfective aspect (simultaneous

action) narked on the verb is ungrarcmatical as in (488) for

example. Where the sequential action is different subject

foll<J<Ning, the conditional rrood particle occurs externally

postposed to the clause. Where the sequential action is

same subject foll<J<Ning, the conditional rrood particle is

incorporated in the verb and replaces the SS narker -me. In

this way conditional rrood can be narked rrorphologically on

the verb. In the unmarked order the conditional clause

precedes, and is subordinated to, the superordinate clause

but the order can be reversed for pragmatic or stylistic

effect (see also 1.1.2.4.2.5.).

can be marked rrorphologically on the verb and is described under 1.1.1. 3.

2.1.3.4.6. 0ptative rrood.

The optative or desiderative rrood has three

expressions; imp.llsive, habitual and contrafactual, and all

three are realized by the impersonal verb construction (see

also 2.1.3.8.).

(i) The qJtative-:hlpll.sive m:iad expresses an irrmecliate

desire or wish to do something and is realized by an

impersonal construction with an imperative VP functioning as

object complement, expressing the imp.llse, followed by

impersonal verb suffixation (see 2.1.3.8.).

There is not a category of intentional rrood as such but purpose or intention can be expressed by an adverbial clause
of purpose (see 1.1.2.4.2.5.).

2.1.3.4.8. Debitive rrood.

The debitive rrood expresses necessary obligation and is realized by an adverbial phrase containing an infinitive verb expressing the obligation followed by the em.EiJ.atic word bahic 'I!UlSt' (see also 1.1.2.4.2.13.).

2.1.3.4.9. Potential rrood.

2.1.3.4.9.1. Physical ability and pennissive rrood.

Physical ability is realized by an equative clause

construction and the pennissive rrood is realized by a rrood

particle.

(i) Physi.caJ. abilicy is realized by an equative clause with

the adjective ihoc 'able' functioning as the predicative

element. This can be rrodified by the negative particle qee

There is no distinct category of narrative m:xxl but the habitual past tense or present (progressive) tense is often used to express a narrative m:xxl in legends or procedural texts rather than the rerrote past tense.

2.1. 3.4.15. Consecutive m:xxl.

There is no distinct rrorphological category expressing consecutive m:xxl but notions of =nsecutiveness and concurrency are expressed by the rredial verb marked for perfective and imperfective aspect respectively (see 2.1.3. 3.2.1.1-2.).

is not r:ossible to bring about the r:ossible =nsequences of

The certain apprehensive sentence can also function as a

subordinated clause and in this case the particle dain

functions as a subordinating =njunction. Unlike other

subordinate clauses (see 1.1.2.) the apprehensive

subordinate clause occurs sentence finally instead of

initially. The subordinated clause is set off in square

the subordinator occurs sentence finally and therefore the

2.1. 3. 5. Finite and ncnfinite facms.

A finite verb is marked for tense desinence and a

nonfinite verb is not marked for tense desinence. There are

four basic types of nonfinite verb: infinitive, which is not

marked for tense/aspect/roood, sequential rredial verb which

is marked for perfective aspect, simultaneous rredial1 verb,

which is rrarked for imperfective aspect and the verb rrarked

for contrafactual rrood. A fifth type of nonfinite verb

occurs where a verb or clause is nominalized or

adjectivalized (see (v) belo.v).

(i) The infinitive form is the citation frn:m of the verb and

also occurs in sentences expressing the rroods: optative-

habitual desire, debitive, hortatory and certain

apprehension. It can also occur in a subordinated clause

expressing purpose (see 1. 1. 2. 4. 2. 4. ) · The infinitive fonn

is comprised of the verb stem, which can include object

markers, followed by the infinitive suffix, either -ec or

-oc, depending upon the class of the verb. While nost verbs

take the suffix -ec a few verbs take -oc in their infinitive

fonn. No phonological or norphological notivation is

apparent for this srrall gramnatical class of verbs which

includes:

aac-oc

'to wipe away'

cacit-oc 'to spit out'

oaq-oc

preceding.

The aspectual categories of perfective and linperfective can only occur on nonfinite verbs (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.1-2.). The aspectual category of iterative can occur on nonfinite or finite -,,erb fonns (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.8.). The aspectual category of habitual can only occur on finite verb forrns (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.3.).

No other category of rrood is rrarked on the nonfinite verb but sane categories of rrood require the verb to be in an infinitive fonn viz. aptative-babitual, debitive and hortatory. The verb can optionally be infinitive for the certain apprehensive rrood. The remaining rroods require the verb to be finite.

2.1. 3. 6.1. Cc:mponents coded in the verb.
The subject is the only category that is obligatorily coded in all finite verbs. The subject is nonnally encoded in all nonfinite rredial verbs but can be emitted in the sequential SS verb (see 2.1. 3. 5. ) · Also the subject must be encoded in the nonfinite verb rrarked for contrafactual m::xrl. For details of direct object and indirect object coding see 2.1.3.6.2.2-3. below.
2.1.3.6.2. Marking of agreement.
Subject agreement is indicated by a suffix on the verb and there are eight classes of subject agreement suffix. Object(direct and indirect) agreement is indicated by a proncminal clitic attached to the stem of the verb.

2.1.3.6.2.1. Subject agreement rrarking.
All finite verbs I!UlSt take subject person-nurrber agreement suffixation. Only the infinitive fonn of the verb does not take subject person-nunber agreement suffixation (see 2.1.3.5.). The nonfinite rredial verbs all take subject person-nurrber agreement suffixation in underlying fonn but the sequential SS rredial verb can emit the subject agreement as an option (see 2.1.3.5.).
There are eight classes of subject person-nurrber suffixes and these are shown in table 2.4 below. The table also shows the tenses/aspects/rroods that the suffixes relate to. · These eight classes can be divided into two main related groupings as shown in the table. Set 1, classes 1-4, obviously derive from the same source. 'l'he only difference between class 1 and class 2 is that in class 2 third person singular is {~} rrarked whereas in class 1 the morpheme is {-i}. In class 3, the markers for the nonnegative future tenses, the singular fonns are the same as for the singular forms in classes 1 and 2. The third person singular {-igi} fonn appears to be a caribination of the class 1 first and third person singular fonns {-ig} and
{-i}. The second/third person dual and plural forrns {-was}
and {-qag} appear to be some kind of caribination of the class 1 dual and plural first person and second/third person forms {-w} + {-si} and {-q} + {-eig} respectively. The forms of class 4 for the negative future tense are also obviously related. In set 2 the basic form for the set is exemplified by class 5 with class 6 being an abbreviated version. Classes 7 and 8, ha...ever, include aspects of set 1, specifically in the dual and plural second/third person forms.

The subject agreement markers can be suffixed to the verb in different orderings as shown below: Order 1. --Verb stem + Subject agreement + Tense/rrood In order 1 the subject agreement suffixation precedes the tense marking and applies to the present, today's past (imperative rrood), yesterday's past, future, relative future and negative future tense fo:rms. Order 2. --Verb stem + Tense/aspect/rrood + Subject agreement In order 2 the subject agreement suffixation follows the tense/aspect/rrood marking and applies to the habitual past tense/aspect, the perfective (sequential SS) and imperfective (simultaneous DS) aspect and the contrafactual rrood fo:rms. Order 3. --Verb stem+ Subject agreement
(Tense/aspect) In order 3 the subject agreement suffixation i.rrmediately follows the verb stem either as a portmanteau rrorpheme ca:ribining subject marking and tense/aspect, i.e. for the remote past and negative past tense fonns, or simply as a subject marking with tense/aspect marked elseWhere, i.e. for the imperfective (simultaneous) aspect verbs.
2.1.3.6.2.2-3. Direct and indirect object agreerrent marking.
Both direct object(ro) and indirect object(IO) are marked on the verb by pronaninal clitics which are basically the sane for ee.ch category. The only difference being in the third person singular fonns. The fonns are charted below (table 2. 5) along with the free pronouns to which they bear some resemblance.

The difference between ro and IO marking is not in the

clitics themselves, except in the third person singular

case, but rather in the way the clitics attach to the verb.
The ro clitic attaches directly to the verb stem with no

intervening predicate particle, -i (see 2. 1. 3. 6. 12. 1. 11 · ) ·

The predicate particle either follows the ro clitic or

deletes altogether. The IO clitic on the other hand
attaches to the verb stem or verb stem + ro clitic with the

predicate particle intervening. An exemplary paradigm is

given below for the verb qet-ec 'to cut' to illustrate the
difference between ro and IO rrar'king. Subject marking is 3s in each case which is ¢ marked in the present tense. In the ro marking the predicate marker follows the ro clitic in the

singular and first person dual and plural fonns and deletes

in the second/third person dual and plural fonns. In the IO

marking the predicate marker precedes the IO clitic in each

case.

Relative to object narking there is a fundamental

distinction in Amele between verbs which IlRJSt carry an

obligatory object clitic whether there is an overt object NP

or not in the clause, even in the infinitive fonn,. and verbs

where object cliticization is not obligatory. The verbs

without obligatory object cliticization can be further

subdivided into those verbs that can take an optional direct

object clitic and those verbs that cannot take an optional

direct object clitic. Each class of verbs is listed below

there seems to be an underlying notion of goal-oriented

verbs vs. agent-oriented verbs. So the verbs :rrarked with

an obligatory object clitic are the goal-oriented verbs and

the focus of the verb is on the goal towards which the

action of the verb is directed. This comes out rrore clearly

with the meaning of sane verbs rather than others. The

of intransitive vs. transitive since certain verbs must obligal:;orilyhave an object clitic whether there is an overt direct object NP or not and vice versa there are certain verbs that cannot have an object clitic even if there is an overt direct object NP as an argument of the verb.
2.1.3.6.3. Conditioning factors on use of verbal object markers.
The proncminal object clitics occur under the following conditions: (i) where it is a class of verb that has an obligatory object clitic (see 2.1.3.6.2.2-3.). (ii) where the object is human/anirrate a semantic (case) function can be indicated for experiencer, recipient, benefactive, rralefactive, allative or ablative by the object clitic (see 2.1.3.6.2.2-3.). (iii) where the overt object is a free pronoun the verbal proncminal clitic can function in its stead or complementary to it. (549 )Ija (hina} oesul.-h-ig-en.
ls 2s help-2s-ls-fut. 'I will help you. ' (550}Uqa (age) iwa1-ad-igi-an. 3s 3p teach-3p-3s-fut. 'He will teach them.' (iv) where the object is anirrate or inanirrate and dual/plural nurrber an object clitic can optionally be used to indicate the nurrber. (551 )caja eu :fan:in-ad-en. wcrnan that flatter-3p-3s-rem.p 'He flattered those wanen.' (552)Uqa na mel. <X>f-a.1-ein. 3s of child look after-3d-3p-rem.p 'They looked after her two children.

2.1.3.6.4. Features of the noun phrase which~ coded in
-th-e -v-er-b.
A noninfinitive verb is obligatorily coded for subject person-nurrber agreement. An infinitive verb is not coded for subject person-nurrber agreement (see 2.1.3.5.). A finite or nonfinite verb can be obligatorily or optionally coded for direct or indirect object person-nurrber agreement depending on the class of the verb (see 2.1.3.6.2.2-3.). The person can be either first person (speaker) , second person (addressee) or third person (other) · The nurrber can be either singular (one person) , dual (two persons) or

plural (rrore than two persons). The medial nonfinite sequential or simultaneous verb also encodes subject
coreferentiality or noncoreferentiality with the following verb (see 2.1.3.6.7.).

semantic features -in -th-e -ve-r-b.

-

--

There is a discrepancy between the way syntactic and semantic features are coded in the verb in the following
areas: (i) The switch-reference (S/R) system primarily codes identity or nonidentity of subject NP's across clauses. However, as is described under 2.1.3.6.7., the interpretation of what constitutes ' same' or 'different' subject is open to both semantic and pragmatic conditions. The S/R system can rronitor a change of syntactic
subject as no-change i.e. SS if there is also a change from [+AGENT] to [-AGENT]. It is open to interpretation then ~f the S/R system is a syntactic system influenced by semantic factors or if the S/R system is in fact tracking the semantic category of Agent rather than the syntactic category of Subject. The S/R system has also taken on a pragmatic deictic role and can indicate changes of time, place and world. (ii) The way objects (direct or indirect) are marked on the verb reveals a discrepancy between the syntactic notion of
intransitive vs. transitive verbs and the semantic notion of agent-oriented vs. goal-oriented verbs (see 2.1.3.6.2.2-3.).

2.1.3.6.6. Noun phrase agreement across all voices, tenses, aspects, rroods and finite and nonf"lilite fornlS-:--

The features of .NP person-nurrber agreement and the

direct and indirect object semantic features described in

2.1.3.6.2.2-3. apply to all tenses, aspects, rroods and

noninfinitive fonns. (There is only one category of voice -

active.) The infinitive form is not marked for subject

person-nurrber agreement but can be marked for object person-

nurrber agreement.

The features of subject NP

coreference described in 2. 1. 3. 6. 4. and 2. 1. 3. 6. 7. only

apply to the sequential and simultaneous action verbs.

In Airele the linguistic phencmenon of clause chaining occurs whereby many clauses can be conjoined in a
coordinated series forming a single sentence. See 1.1. 2.1. (Subordination) and 1.3.1.1.4. (Coordination) for the criteria for distinguishing coordinate clauses from

292

Morphology
subordinate clauses. It is not unccmron in certain kinds of narrative for fifteen to twenty verbs to be conjoined in a single sentence. In such concatenated clause chains the final verb in the sentence carries the tense and rrood desinence. The structure of this type of sentence is:
J[12] s -> +(s) s[:!J'ENSE +MX>D
+iterative
The final finite verb is therefore termed the ' final' verb although in reality due to factors like subordination and front and end shifting a final verb rray not alv.ays be the final verb of a given sentence. The other verbs in the clause chain are not rnarked for tense or rrood but are dependent on the final verb for tense/rrood desinence and are therefore termed 'dependent' or 'medial' verbs. The medial verb is not rnarked for tense or rrood but instead is marked for some aspectual category. This can be either perfective, imperfective or iterative aspect (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.1-2 and 8. ) · The perfective (sequential action) and imperfective (simultaneous action) aspect verb also carries a rnarker which indicates whether the subject of that verb is coreferential or noncoreferential with the subject of the ircmediately following verb (see 2. 1. 3. 3. 2.1-2. for full descriptions of verb paradigms). Coreferentiality indicates same subject (SS) following and noncoreferentiality indicates different subject (DS) following. Such. a system of SS or DS rnarking is cc:mronly called a switch-reference (S/R) system. 8 In addition to carrying SS or IS marking the medial verb is also rnarked for person-nurrber agreement with its own subject.
The S/R system in Airele is primarily an asym:netrical system as defined by Comrie (1983) in that the subject of the ircmediately following clause (the controlling clause) must be either identical or properly included as a subset of the subject of the anticipatory clause (the rnarked clause) for the anticipatory clause to be rnarked for SS. If these conditions are not rret then the anticipatory clause is rnarked for IS. T'ne reverse holds only if the subject sets across the clauses are identical but if the subject of the anticipatory clause is only a subset of the subject· of the following controlling clause the anticipatory clause will be rnarked for IS. The following sentences illustrate how the S/R system functions for both sequential and simultaneous action verbs: Identical subject sets across clauses:

It should be noted that in Alrele where the subject of the

C'Oiltrolling clause is properly included in the subject of

the marked clause the speaker has no choice but to select SS

marking. In a nunber of PNG languages speakers can

apparently chcose SS or rs marking in these circumstances

according to factors dependent upon a person hierarchy of

1st > 2nd> 3rd (Reesink 1983). In Alrele, hc:l\\ever, such a

or DS rrarking when the subject of the controlling clause is

included in the subject of the rrarking clause is when the

marking clause has a reciprocal simultaneous verb (see 2.1.

3.6.9.). In this case the speaker can choose SS or LS

marking when the controlling clause is not first person.

The S/R system is essentially a syntactic referential system

coreferencing the gram:na.tical subject NP acro~s clauses. ~t

is not influenced, for example, by a change in the semantic

role across clauses of one of the participants in the

subject set of the marking clause. The following examples

show a change of serrantic role across clauses of one of the

subject set participants in the marking clause fran agent to

297

Morphology

recipient in c:ne case and fran agent to experiencer in

another case. Also a change across object NP' s fran

experiencer to recipient is given but in all instances of

change of semantic role it is the syntactic contents of the

subject NP that is tracked and marked for SS since the subject of the controlling clause is either identical to or

a subset of the subject of the marking clause. The fact

that c:ne of the participants of the subject set of the

marking clause has changed semantic role in the controlling

clause does not trigger a DS marking and in fact such a

marking INCUld be ungranmatical.

So far it has been denonstrated that the the primary

function of the S/R system is to anticipate the contents of

the subject NP of the following clause as to Whether it is

same or different to the contents of the subject NP of the

anticipatory clause. An essentially syntactic function. It

has also been derronstrated how this function is not affected

by semantic role changes of subject set participants across

clauses. However it will OCM be shCMt1 how the S/R system is

affected by l:x>th semantic and pragmatic (deictic) factors.

First we will examine the semantic factors.

A corrm:n phenanenon that exists in :ENG languages with

S/R systems is that it is possible to nake an apparently

anomalous reference to a following clause as same subject

When in fact it is granmatically a different subject. This

phenanenon was first described in IDngacre (1972: 7-16) and

later in other -works: Litteral (1972), West (1973), Thunnan
(1975), Davies (1981) am rrost extensively in Foster (1981).

The phenanenon has cone to be known as "clause skipping"

since the referential(marked) clause will apparently skip

over the inrnediately following clause and coreference a

clause further down the clause chain as same subject. This

normally occurs When the skipped over subject is either

inanimate or belongs to a granmatically subordinated clause.

The phenanenon of clause skipping is diagrarrmed below [13].

In this construction clause 1 has a SS "marking that does not

refer to the inrnediately following clause, clause 2, but to

a rrore distant clause in the clause chain, clause 3, in this

case. The subject coreferencing is therefore "anomalous" as

it stands since the subject NPj, of clause 2 is not

identical to nor a subset of the subject NPi, of clause 1.

i. If the coreferencing was in strictly linear concatenation

(i.e. local) then clause 1 should be marked DS to be

gramnatical. The identical subject NP is in fact in clause

3. The fact that the subject NP' s of clause 2 and clause 3

are not identical is indicated by the DS marker on clause 2.

*SS refers to clause 3

This kind of "clause skipping" also occurs in Arnele Where the subject of the following clause is a nonagentive
subject. However it will be argued here that this is in fact not a case of clause skipping and it will be shown that the S/R system does not skip over the nonagentive subject

299

Morphology

but reads it as just that, a subject specified [-AGENT].

Genuine clause skipping does occur, however, where the

inmediately following clause belongs itself to a

subordinated sentence and this is described and illustrated

under 1.1.2. (Subordination).

Cases of ananalous SS reference do occur in the

language involving nonagentive subjects. These can be

(i) the subject of an impersonal verb (see also 2.1.3.8.),

(ii) a body part or (iii) some other inanirrate subject. It

should be noted that the phenarenon outlined here is

clearest with nonagentive subjects (i) and (ii). With (iii)

there is alw:i.ys the possibility that agentivity can be

assigned to the subject even though it is inanirrate. This

depends on a speaker's 'WOrld view or the particular

situation he wishes to describe. Examples of this type

of reference to a nonagentive subject are given below.

ls sim.-walk-ls-SS water finish-3s-tod.p

'As I walked along the rain stopped. '

It is argued in this thesis, h<Jl.\ever, that these are not

incidents of clause skipping as diagrarrmed above; rather the

marking clause a:ireferences the irrmediately following clause

as SS when syntactically it is a change of subject.

Firstly, while it is nost comron in text to find these

incidents of ananalous SS marking in a clause chain where

there is a third clause for the reference of the first

clause to skip down to, occasionally instances occur where

there is no third clause, as in the examples given. The

second clause occurs as the final clause of the sentence.

Therefore the first clause IIUlSt be coreferencing the second

clause directly as SS. Secondly if the S/R marking is

"corrected" on the first clause and it is made IB then this

produces a different meaning as given below.

(60l)Ija be-ce-min wen te-i-a.

wa. he-do-i-a.

ls sim.-walk-ls-IB water finish-3s-tod.p

? 'As I walked along something made the rain stop. '

A IB marking produces the meaning that sane other causal

agent is involved which is not the subject of the following

clause. What seems to be happening then is that it is

300

Morphology

possible to have two different kinds of subject NP in Airele.

One is marked [+AGENT] and one is marked [-AGENT] or

null-AGENT. The S/R system marks a change from

Subjecti [+AGENT] to Subjectj [-AGENT] as SS i.e. no change

in Subject, or rather no change in Agent. Most of the tirre

a Subject is [+AGENT] and therefore a change of Subject is

also a change of Agent but when a Subject is [-AGENT] the

S/R system reveals that it is the Agent that is being

tracked across clauses and not the Subject. Another way of

looking at it would be to say that in this case the change

of Subject is ignored because it does not also involve a

change of Agent.

Examples are given below from text of SS marking involving

the different kinds of [-AGENT] subjects described.

Examples where a IB marking occurs are also given. The

relevant verb is underlined in each case.

In the following examples involving inanimate subjects where

the coreference is D3 it is sometimes not clear whether the

D3 is indicating that another causal agent is involved as in

(615) or that the inanimate subject itself is being

assigned agentivity in this instance as in (616) or

whether pragmatic (deictic) factors of the kind described

In (617) and (618) the underlined D3 verb is probably

indicating a change in place or time setting (see below)

The S/R system also has a pragmatic or deictic function

in that it can indicate a change in time, place or world

setting. A change of time, place or world setting is

indicated by the structure, [14], diagramned below.

Basically there are occasionally "anomalous" D3 markings on

verbs across clauses that have t:i:ie same subject NP. The

explanation given by native speakers as to the reason for

such instances is that "something has changed" or this is "a

neN situation" and often it is obvious that the change being

indicated is deictic rather than syntactic and tliat these

deictic changes are in the area of time, place or world

reference p::>ints. For example a change of time marked by

the S/R system is often backed up by a temp::>ral expression;

a change of place marked by the S/R system occurs rrost

frequently with verbs of rrotion and a change of location can

also be indicated by a locative expression; a change of

world marked by the S/R system is normally a switch fran an

intended or proposed action to the real action itself or

vice versa, i.e. a switch fran real action to intended

action.

2.1. 3.6.8. Reflexive verbs.

2.1.3.6.9. Reciprocal verbs.

The reciprocal verb is realized by two coordinate serial verbs aribedded within a matrix verb. The two coordinate verbs are identical in structure and each coreferences an individual reciprocant. Both coordinate verbs are rrarked for third person singular subject and for different subject (DS) following. Therefore they cross reference each other even though they are in linear sequence. The coordinate verbs have two different structures depending on whether there is an indirect object pronaninal clitic present or not. If the coordinate verbs do not have an IO clitic then their structure is a verb stem or a paratactic series of verb stems with an optional direct object pronaninal clitic followed by DS and subject person-nurrber agreement suffixation and this structure is diagram:ned below in [15]. If there is an IO clitic present then the structure of the coordinate verbs is an indirect object pronaninal clitic follo.ved by DS and subject person-nurrber agreement suffixation and this is diagram:ned below in [16]. The pronaninal object clitics suffixed to the verb stem must also be in the third person singular. If the verb stem is included in the coordinate verb sequence then the matrix verb comprises just a verbal suffix following the coordinate verbs. If the verb stem is not included in the coordinate verb sequence then it precedes the coordinate verbs as part of the matrix verb structure and the coordinate verbs are followed by the matrix verb suffixation. The rratrix verb suffixation comprises subject person-nurrber agreerrent for the reciprocant group as a whole together with appropriate tense/aspect/rocx:xl rrarking. Thus the aribedded coordinate verbs coreference the reciprocants on a one-to-one basis and must therefore be 3s. The matrix ve:b, on the other hand, coreferences the reciprocant group, which can be either dual or plural in nurrber. See also

2.1.3.6.10. Directional verbs.

There are no specific verbs indicating rrotion tov.ards

or away fran the speaker/hearer but rrotions in different

directions: to and fran a point, up at an inclination, down

at an inclination, up vertically, down vertically etc. can

be indicated by a paratactic series of verbs Where the final verbal element is realized by a rrotion verb. The notion

verb adds the directional meaning to the situation expressed

by the first verb and carries the verbal suffixation. The

first verb is rrarked only by the predicate rrarker -i. The

notion verbs that function in this way are:

2.1.3.6.12.1. Incorporation.

There are many verb phrases Which consist of a verb and
an adjunctive element Which can be a noun, noun J?11:ase, verb, adjective, adjective phrase, adverb o~ .i;:ostpos~tional phrase. These are analyzed as comp::>und VP s i.e. a':1Junct + verb. Such comp::>unding occurs rrost frequent!¥ with the verbs q-oc 'to hit' and m-ec 'to put' although it can oc;:cur
with other verbs. In such a cornp::>und VP the verb functions as a copular verb and the meaning is carried by the
adjunctive element. Often the meaning is idiomatic and cannot be determined fran the individual elements of the cornp::>und VP however. Most of the adjunctive elements that
have been observed to date in cornp::>und VP's also.have an
independent existence else..ihere in the lar:iguage and 7t would seem that cornp::>unding with m-ec and especially q-oc is ~Uy
productive in that they can corribine with alrrost any naro.nal or adjectival element to produce a cornp::>und VP c;md often c;m idiomatic expression. This supports the analysis that in this capacity q-oc and m-ec are , functi~ng as '?°pular verbs. The cornp::>und VP' s sanan m-ec to start and Cl.t q-oc ' to bring to a conclusion' also have aspectual values (see
2.1.3.3.2.1.6-7.). A few adjunctive elements only occur in a cornp::>und VP and do not have an independent existence.

Verb incorporation would be nore accurately described

as a a::xnplex VP structure of verb + auxiliary where the verb

q-oc 'to hit' functions as an auxiliary verb. This

structure is described here under incorporation since nost

of these forms have an idianatic meaning similar to the

forms incorporating naninal and adjectival elements but in

actuality this is a type of serial verb construction (see 2.

Another type of verb incorporation also occurs in relation

to Pidgin verbs and this is fully productive. A verbal

suffix d-oc 'cbject marker' is attached to a Pidgin verb to

'Amelize' it. This occurs where an Amele term does not

exist or it is rrore convenient to use a Pidgin term - for example:

2.1.3.6.12.1.10. Inco:rporation of negative elements.

, TI;e negati';"e rro~emes -1 'negative past' and -u negative future are included in the verb where there is a
negative particle qee 'not' or oain 'don't' preceding the
verb or in the apprehensive rrood (see 2. 1. 3. 3. 2.1.17. ) ·

2.1.3.6.12.1.11. Inco:rporation of predicate marker.

A predicate marker -i occurs with some verbal

constructions. It occurs in the sequential action same sub~ect verbs following the verb stem and preceding the same

sub]ect marker (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.1.). The subject marker and

SS ~ker can be anitted when the verb occurs as part of a

serial verb construction leaving just the verb stem and the

predicate marker (see 2. 1. 3. 5 and 7. ) ·

go-pred.-SS-3s

(660)nu-i fe-i-a

'he went and saw'

go-pred. see-3s-tod.p
in:e main ~ctioi; ~f the predicate marker is to distinguish

direct cbJect clitics from indirect object clitics (see 2.1.

3.6.2.2-3.). The direct object clitic attaches directly to

the verb stem and the predicate marker either follows the

dire~ object clitic or deletes altogether whereas the

predicate marker must occur between the indirect object

312

Morphology

clitic and the verb stem in which case it often coalesces

with the final vowel (either -e or ~) of the verb.

get-3p-ls-fut.

(664)u-ad-iq-e:i

'I will get (it) for them.'

The predicate marker can also occur as an independent

element with certain adverbials.

not pred. 3s-neg.p

(666 )tuna. tuna. i

ned-en 'he spoke in awe'

pred. say-3s-rem.p

It can also be argued that the predicate marker is the only

realization of the verb 'to give' which ccmprises just verb

suffixation and has no overt verb stem. Ho.Jever <Xlmp3.ring

(667) (an instance of 'give' with indirect object

suffixation) with (668) (an instance of an impersonal verb

with direct object suffixation) it can be seen that the

predicate marker does occur in the case of the verb 'to

give'.

2 .1. 3. 7. Strings of verbs.

Clause chaining is a c:omron occurrence in the language and the reader is referred to section 2.1.3.6. 7. for a description of the switch-reference system that is integral to the clause chaining phenanenon. As well as clauses occurring in a coordinated sequence verbs alone can also be strung together in paratactic serial verb constructions.9
In such constructions only the final verb in the series will carry the verb rrorphology, either verb !redial suffixation or verb final suffixation, and the other verb(s) will be a
reduced form of the verb i.e. either verb stem(cibject clitic) + predicate rrarker or verb stem(cibject rrar~er) + subject agreement rrarker. In other "WOrds either the same subject (SS) rrarker and the subject agreement rrarker is deleted or the predicate rrarker and the SS rrarker is deleted. These verbs are also known as 'stripped down'
verbs. See section 2.1. 3. 5. (Nonfinite forms) for the norphological form of these reduced verbs. Such verb series only occur where the subject NP is the same for all the
verbs in the series. As well as stringing together a series of verbs that describe a close knit and related sequence of
actions the serial verb construction has sane specialized functions: (i) the final verb in the series can add an aspectual meaning to the preceding verb(s) (see 2.1.3.3.). (ii) the final verb in the series can function as a copular verb to either produce a comp;:>und rooaning with the preceding verb(s) in the series or add no extra rooaning at all (see 1.2.1.1. and 2.1.3.6.12.1.9.).
(iii) the final verb in the series can function to carry object rrarkers where the preceding verb(s) in the series cannot carry cibject rrarkers (see 2.1.3.6.2.2-3.).
(iv) the final verb in the series can be a directional verb and add directional rooaning to the verb series (see 2.1.3.6.
10.).
Examples are given belaw of paratactic verb series taken from text naterial. Most of these paratactic series
ccmprise just two verbs but up to five have been recorded in text. Where the series does not ha.ve one of the specialized
functions m:mtioned above there is no restriction on clausal elements that can occur between the paratactic verbs.

2.1.3.8. Inpersala1. verbs.

The impersonal verb construction can be comprised of

either (i) an experiencer NP and a cause NP fella.Ned by a

verbal ending or (ii) an experiencer NP and a verbal

ccmplement element fella.Ned by a verbal ending. With type

(i) the experiencer NP is coreferenced by the verbal ending

as syntactic cibject. Subject agreement on the verbal ending

is always third person singular and this would indicate that

the cause NP functions as subject. However it is

ungrarrmatical for the experiencer and cause NP's to occur in

the unrrarked order of SOV. The experiencer NP (O) must

always precede the cause NP (S) with an order of osv. So,

while (679) belaw is grarmatical (680) is not.

Morphology

This can be explained by the pragmatic notion of topic (see

also 1.12.) whereby the experiencer NP being [+HUMAN] and

higher on the ani.rracy hierarchy than the cause NP, [-HUMAN],

takes the topic position normally occupied by the syntactic

subject i.e. preceding syntactic object and normally

sentence initial. The nominal elements expressing cause are

realized by a closed class of nominals some of which only

occur in the impersonal verb construction. These are rrerked

by + below. The other nominals can occur elsewhere as free

forms. All the forms below are listed in the present tense

which is zero rrerked for third person singular subject.

It should be noted that in Amele the verb 'to give' does not

have a verb stem and is realized by verbal suffixation alone

similar to the impersonal verb. With the verb 'to give',

ho.vever, other inflections of subject person-nurrber than 3s

can be realized and also the normal order of SDV occurs.

In the negative form of the type (i) impersonal verb

construction the negative particle qee 'not' can precede

either the verbal suffix or the cause NP but it is

ungrarrmatical for qee to precede the experiencer NP. This

w01ld give further evidence that the experiencer NP is

functioning like a subject NP (i.e. as topic) since the

The impersonal verb construction, type (ii), with the verbal

element functioning as verbal ccmplement is fully productive

and expresses the optative rrood (see 2.1.3.4.6.). The

verbal ccmplement element can be realized by either a VP in

the imperative rrood or a VP in the rerrote past tense. The

former expresses a present or future desire while the latter

expresses a contrafactual desire. As with the type (i)

impersonal verb the object pronaninal clitic in the verbal

suffix agrees in person and nurrber with the experiencer NP

and the verb is always realized with 3s subject. Exemplary

cece/cese 'yes', qee 'no', cois 'OK' and nel.e 'truly' (see

also 1.1.1.2.4.2. and 1.2.1.3.1.1.). The rrood particles :fo

and dain can also function as subordinating conjunctions and

qa and :fo can also function as coordinating conjunctions

(see 1.3.1.1.2-3.). The negative particle qee 'not' and

the prohibitive particle oain 'don't' can also be preposed

to the verb in the verb phrase to negate the proposition.

Morphology

2.2.1.2. Nouns :fran verbs.

Many verbs can function as nouns in their nani.nalized

fonn. A nani.nalized verb is fanned by the suffixation of

the nominalizing/adjectivalizing clitic -ec/-<X!/-doc to the

verb stem. In this respect the ncminalized fonn of the verb

is identical to the infinitive fonn.

2. 2. 2. 2. Vertis fJ:an vertJs.

A verb is derived fran a verb whenever it is reduplicated to indicate imperfective or iterative aspect (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.2 and 8. for the various types of reduplicated verb that can occur) · Verbs can also be
derived fran verbs by c::ornfOunding with other verbs in a paratactic series (see 2.1.3.7.).

2. 2. 3. 2. Adjectives fJ:an veros.

Many verbs can function as adjectives in their

adjectivalized form. The adjectivalized verb is formed by

suffixing the

naninalizing/adjectivalizing

clitic

-ec/-oc/-cbc to the verb stern. In this respect the

adjectivalized form of the verb is identical to the

Notes to table 3.1: (i) The features used in table 3.1 are basically those proposed in 'The Sound Pattern of English' (Chomsky and Halle 1968). However since Amele does not distinguish
lip-rounded frcm nonlip-rounded consonants and as there is a close phonological correlation between labial consonants and

332

Phonology

rounded ~ls (see 3.4.1.1.) the cover feature [ROUND] is

used to des=ibe lx>th labial consonants and rounded ~ls.
(ii) In Amele the nasals /m/ and /n/ pattern with the other
CXJ!ltinuants /f,h,1,s/ in ~l insertion rules (see below)
and are therefore specified as [+CXJ!lt]. /m/ and /n/ also pattern with /1/ in deletion rules (see 3.4.4.1.). /m/ patterns with /hi in rounding rules (see 3.4.1.1.).

e.g.

UR SR
1¢ + g/ -> [gbelfik] 'his bald head' /dab + g/ -> [d~~] 'his ear' /?OJ. + g/ -> (?Ol.ik] 'his rraturity' /gos + g/ -> [gJsfk] 'his hair'

As [gb] oontrasts with both /b/ and /q/ in many identical

environments it is analyzed as the independent phcneme /fj,/.

There is evidence, however, fran the verb norphology that
/fj,/ and /bl are neutralized in word final position and are

both realized by the phone [p] in this position. There are

two orderings of subject person-mmber and tense/aspect

norphemes in the verb (see also 2.1. 3.6. 2.1. ) · In one order

the subject person-mmber norpheme precedes the tense/aspect

norpheme and in the other order the tense/aspect rcorpheme

precedes the subject person-mmber norpheme. When the

subject person-mmber norpheme precedes the tense/aspect

norpheme first person plural is realized by the allarorph {~} but when this verb category follows the tense/aspect

norpheme it is realized by the allorrorph {p}. This is

illustrated by the data below.

The above distribution of [3] applies princip;tlly to

rronarorphemic words. For polyrrorphemic words the

distribution is rrore general. Where reduplication occurs

[3] can occur word medially preceding other VO'Aels than [i].

Also with certain verbs the verb stem arbitrarily has a

final [3] which means phonologically a word medial [3] can

occur before any VO'Ael in certain inflections of the verb.

However, since no instance of phonemic contrast occurs

betvieen [j] and [:}] and in fact when [j] and [3] do occur as

alternants in the same environment, as in /ma:jag/ and /?a-ja./

3.2. PHONOI'ACTICS.

Word internal oonsonant clusters only occur with a few lexical items (see 3. 2. 2.1. ) · For these items the fonnula below applies where a word can be cx:>mp:>sed of fra:n two to three syllables with any CV pennutable fra:n the fo:anula:
(C)V(C) ( (C) (V) (C)) ( (C) (V) (C)) For rrost lexical items including all verb and inalienably possessed noun stems, ho.vever, internal oonsonant clustering does not occur so the fo:anula below is applicable where a word or verb/mun stem can be cx:>mp:>sed of fra:n one to three syllables and have a CV a::xrbination pe:anutable fra:n the formula:
(C)V(C) (V(C) (V(C))) Verb stems and noun stems can be reduplicated in which case it is no:anally the first (C)V that reduplicates. Also verb stems and inalienably possessed noun stems can be inflected with various suffixes. The maximum nurrber of syllables that can be added to the verb stem in the way of subject and object agreement suffixes is four and this gives a possible syllable pattern for the fully inflected verb of:
(C)V I(C)V(C) (V(C) (V(C))) I (C)V(C) (V(C) (V(C) (V(C))))
The inalienably possessed noun stem can take up to two syllables as possessive suffixes and this gives a possible syllable a::xrbination for the inalienably possessed noun of:
(C)V: (C)V(C)(V(C)(V(C))) IV(C)( (V) ((C)))
Verb stems and inalienably possessed noun stems do not occur as independent phonological words but always as part of a
larger phonological phrase unit. The phonological word is a rhythm unit having one rrajor stress placement, the physical rranifestation of stress being relatively greater intensity often accompanied by relatively
higher pitch. In general the roundaries of phonological and grarrmatical words ooincide. Where a word appears to be longer than three syllables it can usually be determined by

345

Phonology

stress placement that it is in fact rrore than one word as a phonological word unit only takes one ID3.jor stress placement. For example the following lexeme turns out to be two words.
[ ·ae.si..u. 'lik] /asi Wig/ 'fern species'
Stress placement can also differentiate duplicated nouns i.e. a noun phrase, frcm reduplicated nouns i.e. a phonological word (see 1.16.1. ) ·
3. 2 .1.1. ·wam fina1 cooscnants.
All consonants can occur word finally. Ha.-;ever sane can only occur as allophonic variants in word final position as indicated in table 3.4 below.

Word final variant [p] [p]

[3] [v]

The occurrence of /fjo/ in word final position is
controversial since this can only be deduced frcm the verb ~hology (see 3 .1. 2.1.1. (5)) but there is one example of [j,] occurring in a syllable final, verb stem final position in the lexical item
['tuj,.d:>?] /~?/ 'to butcher' This contrasts with
['tub.d:>?] /t:J:Ub?/ 'to join' These data lend support to the analysis that /~/ occurs word finally but as the phone [p]. Nevertheless, unless it can be substantiated that a particular instance of word
final [p] can be assigned to the phoneme /'io/ all instances
of word final [p] are arbitrarily assigned to the phoneme
/b/.
3. 2.1. 2. wam initial cooscnants.
All consonants can occur word initially. H~ver the
CV sequences /ju/ and /wu/ are very rare. Only two instances of word initial /ju/ have been recorded in sane 5000 lexical items and no instance of word initial /wu/ has
so far been recorded.

346

Phonology

3. 2. 2. 1. wam inteI:na1 cc:nsaiant clusters.

The language does not permit word or stem initial or

final consonant clusters but consonant clustering can occur

word rredially with certain lexical items (often names which

ID3.Y be sane kind of reduced or camp:>site form) and across

the rrorpheme ooundary of verb stem and verbal suffix where

object clitics are attached to the verb stem. Sane lexical

items with word rredial consonant clusters are:

[ '.:en.se]
[3£. 'w<J:"L.ti]

'left hand' 'wind frcm north'

['1.ae?.cjiaz.a] 'scorpion'

[ 'mtl.du]

'srrall spirit being with long black

hair and white skin'

Sane names that have word rredial consonant clusters are:

Danben Je1so

a village name meaning 'the big fig tree'
a village name derived frcm [3 .? 1 .so]

'a breadfruit tree'

M:isangul a sID3.Il 1 name

The possible object clitics that can be suffixed to the verb

stem to produce a consonant cluster are (see also 2.1.3.6.1.

2-3):

[-t£?] 'rre'

[ -41£7]

I you I

[-dE?] 'him'

[-le?]

1US(2) I

[-g£7] 'us'

The following consonant clusters can therefore occur across

the verb stem and object clitic rrorpherne ooundary:

One example of this clustering would be:

[sun'ten] /sun+t£!n/

'he pushed rre'

[sun'hEn] /suntban/

'he pushed you'

[sun' d:>n] /surtk'bl/

'he pushed him'

[sun'len] /sunt-lJi!!n/

'he pushed us(2)'

[sun'gen] /suntqen/

'he pushed us'

Where it is the case that such consonant clustering produces

a geminate cluster then the cluster is realized phonetically

by one rrerril:>er of the cluster (see also 3. 3. 1. 3-7. ) · That is

3.2.3.3. Sequences of vowels.

The vocoid sequences [ax], [Q'l.f], [eI], [E'lf], [~I], [ou] are interpreted as the phoneme sequences /ai/, /au/, /ei/,
/eu/, /oi/, /cu/ respectively which form complex W syllabic
nuclei in either open or close syllables. These diphthongs are illustrated in the chart (table 3.5) bel0\\1. This analysis avoids the problems of either (a) interpreting the vocoid sequences as complex phonemes, which would add six additional vowel phonemes to the phoneme inventory, or (b) interpreting the vocoid sequences as a sequence of
vowel plus semiconsonant and establishing the additional syllable structure patterns (C)VCC, which otherwise would not occur in the language.

The vowel clustering pattern of the language also supports

such an analysis in that all p:>ssible corribinations of vowel

clusters, including the reverse diphthongal sequences, can

occur as shown in the chart (table 3.6) bel0\\1.

However, the occurrence of sequences of syllabic vov.els word

~ occur word initially rather the sequences /ja/, /wa/,

Another support for analyzing the diphthongs as complex w

~ences is that when. reduplication occurs involving a

diphthong only the first vov.el in the complex nucleus is

reduplicated. This suggests therefore that nnderlyingly the

diphthongs are separate vov.els.

Phonology

3. 2.4. Differences ~ structure of 1exica1 ~
-an-d -"10-.r-ds.
The phonological structure of words differs frcm that of rrorphemes in two ways: (i) Certain consonant clusters occur across rrorpheme 001.mdaries within the verb which do not occur within rrost rrorphernes themselves. A feM consonant clusters do occur in sane lexical items within the rrorpherne b.lt these items are considered as not confonning to the standard rrorpherne pattern of the language. This is described nnder 3.2.2.1. (ii) Certain vov.el sequences only occur across rrorpherne
001.mdaries. These are /ue/, /ae/, /ea./, /iu/, /oe/, /aa/, /ii/, /uu/ (see 3.2.3.3. above for examples).

3.2.5.L Assigrment of medial. units, clusters and sequences to syJ Jab]es.

A syllable 001.mdary occurs in the envirorunent V(C) (C)V

where the first and second vov.els do not fonn the W

sequences /a.i./, /an/, /ei/, /eu/, /oi/ and /OJ./

respectively. These sequences are considered to fonn a

single syllable with complex nuclei of W structure (see 3.

2.3.3.). In rrost cases a syllable 001.mdary coincides with a

rrorpherne 001.mdary b.lt there are exceptions to this as

described below where either (i) a diphthong sequence of

vowels or (ii) a geminate vowel cluster funning a phonetic

long vov.el can occur across a rrorpherne ootmdary.

(i) Off-glide sequences.

The off-glide sequences [ar], [q'lf], [er], [E'l.f], [JI], [ol..l']

can occur as a single syllabic nucleus either within the

rrorpherne or across a rrorpheme ootmdary.

Word/syllable final consonant clusters do not occur. The consonant-'\IOl.\el and consonant-diphthong sequences Which occur word or syllable finally are given in table 3.8 belo<N. Those sequences enclosed in parentheses occur only syllable finally but not word finally. Those Which are not in parentheses also occur word finally. An asterisk indicates that the sequence does not occur syllable or wo:t:d finally. Orthographic syrrmls rather than phonemic syrrmls are used in this table for convenience of presentation.

In principle there is no restriction on cooccurrence of segmants across syllable or word boundaries. It is just

Length is not nonnally contrastive but voviel lengthening does occur and in sane cases this produces a contrast in meaning. This phenanenon is not analyzed as being phonologically significant and is of canp:i.ratively low incidence in the total phonological system. The explanation
for voviel length appears to lie in factors related to accidental historical developrrent rather than in the synchronic sound system.

3.3.1.1. Vowel length.

The phonetic long. voviels [e:] and [:> : ] occur in words

like [gi:,E:] 'no', [m&:n] 'stone', [?:>:'lik] 'his White hair'

and [s:>:1] 'wallaby' and sets of contrastive pairs exist in

the lexicon for the voviels [e] - [:] and [:J]

[:J:]

respectively. Examples are given below:

[] [:]

[be] 'his neck' [gbe:] 'not'

[bm] 'big'

[gbs:n] 'centipede'

[dE1] 'tree'

[de:1] 'day'

[me1J 'ooy'

[me:1] 'weed'

[mm] 'he put'

[me:n] 'stone'

[:>] [:>:]

[?:>1] 'l::owstring' [:>:1] 'famine'

[d:>l] 'ghost'

[d:>:1] 'neat'

[ho] 'pig'

[1:>:] 'hospitality'

[m:>1] 'thatch'

[m:l:1] 'a::>a::>nut cream'

[s:>l] 'stick'

[s:>:1] 'wallaby'

However, because of factors like deficient distribution and

~the absence of allophonic variants for the long vowels they

are analyzed as the geminate W clusters [EE] and [:>~].

Evidence fran the verb rrorphology and canp:i.rison with

related languages supports this interpretation.

In the rerrote past tense the rrorpheme for first and second

person singular can be deduced as {-em} fran the direct

speech forms where just the subject agreement of the verb is

copied to the postquote position (see also 1.1.1.1. ) · In

the rerrote past tense form itself, however, the first and

second person forms have long phonetic voviels as in the

examples below:

[ff:m] 'I/yo.i saw.'

Du :m] ' I /yo.i cane. '

The underlying forms are therefore analyzed as having the

rrorpheme {-en} producing long phonetic voviels in the surface

fonns. In the case of [h:i:m] the [E] assimilates to the

preceding [::>] voviel in the verb stem.

Contrastive length does not occur in the nonsyllabics. In scme constructions of the verb consonant clusters can occur across rrorpheme lx>undaries involving the object verbal clitics (see 2.1.3.6.1.2-3. and 3.2.2.1.). Where it is the case that such consonant clustering produces a geminate cluster then the cluster is realized phonetically by one
member of the cluster. That is

3.3.2.L Stress.

Stress does not play a significant role in the phonology of the language except that heavy stress is associated with certain intonation patterns (see 3.3.4.1.)
and is also used to emp:rasize sentence constituents. Stress does not distinguish lexical items fran one another.

3.3.2.2. Ph::netic cxa::relates of stress.

The nucleus of a stressed syllable is pronounced with greater intensity than the nucleus of an unstres~ed syllable, and sanetimes with higher pitch. Also the quality of the vow:il, tense or lax, can indiC'.ate if the syllable is a stressed or unstressed syllable, for example [ ] only occurs word finally in unstressed syllables (see 3.1.2.2.
1.).

3. 3. 2. 3. D:istinct.iaJs bebileen di:f£erent 1evel.s of stress·

There is no distinction between different levels of stress.

3. 3. 2. 4--5. Positi.cn of stress.

There are two patterns of stress placement depending on the rrorphological structure of the word. Stress placement on rronarorphemic words (i.e. all words except verbs and
possessed nouns) is phonologically con<;titioned _and predictable. Stress placement on polyrrorpherm.c words (i.e.
verbs and possessed nouns) is grarrmatically conditioned a.i;d predictable but to a lesser degree than for rronc:m::>rpherm.c
wards. For nonarorphemic words stress, [+stress], falls on the
first closed syllable (Which is usually though not necessarily the last syllable in the word) or, if there is no closed syllable, then on the first syllable. For the

357

Phonology

purposes of stress placement an off-glide functions as a

closed syllable when it occurs in word final position. In

other word positions it functions as an open syllable.

Stress placement for rronarorphemic words can therefore be

expressed.by two ordered rules, [l] and [2] below, where [2]

only applies if [l] has not applied.

and s~ess can be placed on any of the following elements

Also in this category is included the verb expcressing

contrafactual rrood and the negative future tense where the

element expcressing contrafactuality ocr negation is stressed

in each case. The relative element is underlined in the

following examples.

(2) Stress placement for}?ossessed nouns. With the inalienably possessed n~ there is a general

stress rule whereby main stress is placed on the final

without variation excluding the first person singular forms

where there is variation according to the grarrmatical class

For the first person singular forms Ill3.in stress can be

placed on either the final syllable or the penultinate syllable depending on the WO:d i~se~f. :t;Io forI!l3.l

explanation has been found for this variation as it does not

seem to conform to either phonological or rrorphological

criteria, although the placement of stress is usually

consistent within one gramrcatical class. For example all

the forms in classes 26-31 which take a ls suffix -i have

final syllable stress.
C26 /tanal+i/ -> (talnR'li]
C27 /Ot:XJ+i/ -> [do'di]

I rrw wife I S father I 'rrw great grandparent/

child'

c28 fbin+-i/ -> [bx'ni]

'rrw father's sister'

C29 /wal+i/ -> [wCR.'li]

'rrw brother'

C30 /ast-i/ -> [pe. 'si]

'rrw grandparent/child'

C31 /amH/

-> . [~'mi]

I rrw eye I

All the forms that have an underlying stem final -n in

classes 2,3 and 7 take syllable final stress.

C2 /silintni/ -> [sLIJ:'ni]

'rrw navel'

C3 /gemantni/ -> [gtm·'ni]

'rrw liver'

C7 /?eD11i!!D:+ni/ -> [?cmE.'ni]

I rrw presence I

Yet this does not apply to other classes that

can be

analyzed rrorphologically on the sane b3.sis. For example

classes 9 and 10 clearly have underlying forms with stem final -n yet scrre members of these classes take syllable

final stress and others take penultinate syllable final

stress.

C9 /?rihJntni/ -> [?uhV'ni] /gelfhlntni/ -> [ge1&'h:tni]

'rrw flesh' 'rrw bravery'

-> [U:>1t'ni]

'rrw forearm/hand'

'rrw upper arm'

All the forms in classes 19 and 24 with clear first person

rrorphemes -ni and -mi respectively take final syllable

stress.
Cl9 /beffii/ -> [b&.'ni] 'rrw neck' C24 /ilD+mi/ -> [il:> 'mi] 'rrw head'

However all the forms in classes 17, 18 and 21, which are

rrorphologically similar to classes 19 and 24 above in that

they take first person suffixes -mi or -ni have penultinate

stress placement.

3. 3.4.1. Int.aiaticn patterns.

There are two rrajor intonation patterns for norI!13.l indicative, interrogative, imperative, supplicative, conditional, optative, debitive, permissive, emfilatic, dubitive, hortatory, prohibitive, apprehensive, habitual, prescriptive, contrafactual, regretful and vocative rrood sentences: final and nonfinal. The final intonation pattern is characterized by gradual falling intonation over the final element in the sentence, otherwise intonation pitch is fairly level over the v.ihole sentence except for the intonation peak (see 3.3.4.2. below). The final intonation pattern accanp:mies sentence final clauses. The nonfinal
intonation pattern is characterized by a rising intonation over the final element in the constituent to which the intonation pattern applies (e.g. word, phrase or sentence). The nonfinal intonation pattern is characteristic of subordinated and coordinated clauses (see 1.1.2. and 1.3.1. 1.4. respectively).

in line with other hanronic epenthetic vowel processes (see

(3) Consonants assimilating to VOW'els.

There is a clear phonological rule in the possessed noun
rrorphology of /n/ -> /m/ following a [+round] vowel.

Fo:rmally the rule is

[ll]

[+round] / $1 V

+

[+round]

This rule applies to the first and second person forms in

the noun classes 15, 17 and 24 with stem final [+round]

vowels. For example the following derivations are

applicable:

Cl5 /?igu:fni/ -> [?igumi]

'my snivel'

/?igu:fn/ -> [?iguiii]

'your snivel'

Cl7 /bibi:to+n:i/ ->
/mhitotn/ -) C24 /silo+n:i/ ->
/sil:D+n/ ->

[bihltani] [bihltciii]
[silxmi.J [sihclli]

'my buttocks' 'your buttocks I
'my temple' 'your temple'

This rule does not apply to-the forms in class 19 with stem

final [+round] vowels, e.g. [?o+ni] 'my lips', because of

the syllable restriction on the noun stem. Specifically the

rule only applies to noun stems of rrore than one syllable.

Also the rule does not apply to forms in classes 2, 3, 9, 10

and 12 where it appears the noun stem has a final [+round]

vowel from the surface form but the possessive suffix is

-ni. It can be shown independently that these forms in fact

have a stem final n and hence are not subject to the rule.

For all these forms the underlying suffixes for first and

second person singular are -ni and -n respectively. In the

second person forms an epenthetic vo11Vel, -i-, is inserted

between the noun stem and the suffix. This sho.vs clearly in

classes 2, 9 and 12. In classes 3 and 10 the stern final n

is deleted between a [-high] and a [+high] vowel.

367

Phonology

Derivations are given below for fonns from classes 2, 9 and

12 with the vowel insertion(VI) rule.

For the fonns in classes 3 and 10 there is a sonorant

deletion(SD) rule following the VI rule.

There is one further fonn that provides an apparent

counterexample to rule [11] and that is gem.mi/gem.m
'ilf/your husband' in class 1. H~ver, later rules will

show that there is a principle of dissirnilation operating in

the phonology such that a rounding rule like [11] will not

operate if there is a [+round] consonant in the final

syllable of the noun stern. So [11] needs modifying to [12]

to account for gem.mi/gem.m:

[12]

[+~sal] -> [+round] I $1

C

V+

-round

[-round] [+round]

(4) Consonants assimilating to consonants.

There is another process in the inalienably possessed noun
system such that /n/ -> /m/ in a certain environment

associated with [+round] consonants. This process can be

accounted for by a rule such as [ 13] below:

[13]

c

[

+nasal] -round

->

[+round]

/

C [+round]

$2 + _

Rule [13] accounts for the following fonns:

Set (a)

C8 /?ebina:tni/ -> [?ebinauri]
Cl6 /qabalatni/ -> [gal-eJamj]

'ilf sister' 'm.1 shoulder blade'

'ilf knee '

It can be seen that rule [13] accounts for a large section

of the data l:x>th positively in set (a) and negatively in set

(b) by the restrictive principle of dissirnilation i.e. on

the same basis as for rule [12], the rounding does not apply

if there is a [+round] consonant in the syllable irrmediately

preceding the place of operation. Hc:Mever there are some

fonns for which rule [13] does not account. Sane fonns have

the correct envirornnent as specified in the rule but do not

undergo the rounding process - set (c) below. Other fonns

do not have the specified envirornnent but undergo the

rounding process - set (d) below.

There is comp3I'ative evidence that the fonns in set (d)

diachronically satisfied the environment in rule [13]. The

historical reconstructions for set (d) -were probably:

[neim:i]

[safalami.]

[faimi.]

Hc:Mever diachronic processes do not play any part in

synchronic processes as the speaker has no access to this

data. Rule [13] is therefore an opaque rulel2 and should be

abandoned as a productive phonological rule in the language.

These fonns should therefore be related by norphological

369

Phonology

relational rules in the lexicon rather than by a phonological rule.

3. 4 .1. 2. Dissimi 1atacy processes.

A dissimilatory process is the underlying explanation for some phonological rules (see rules [12] and [13] in 3.4.
1.1.). Specifically in the following derivation the rule of n -> m following a [+round] vowel does not apply because there is an irrmediately preceding [+round] consonant.
/geau+ni/ -> [gem.mi] 'Il!Y husband'
Canpare other forms where there is no irrmediately preceding [+round] consonant and the rounding rule does apply:
/tn?ufni/ -) [tu?umi] 1 IT\Y thigh I /ilotni/ -> [ilaoi] 'Il!Y head'
Similarly the principle of dissimilation applies to prevent the process n -> mwhen there is a [+round] consonant in the
noun stem if that consonant is in the syllable irrmediately preceding the rrorpheme break.
/fi:,afi+ni/ -> [9baflni] 'Il!Y bald head' /bauri+ni/ -) [bamini] I scrotum'
Again COI!Ip:lre forms where the [+round] consonant is not in the irrmediately preceding syllable.
/gabala:t'rd/ -> [gamlanri] 'Il!Y shoulder blade' /beilafni/ -) [beilanri] 11T!Y tongue I
Therefore there is a general dissimilatory principle blocking the derivation of a [+round] nasal when there is a [+round] consonant in the syllable irrmediately preceding the derivational site.

Phonology

3. 4. 2. Metathesis processes.

Metathesis processes ~ in several derivations:

(i) The rrorpheme {-ig} represents second/third person plural

in the following forms:

[fe+ig+a]

'you/they saw(tod.p)'

[fe+ig+an]

'you/they saw(yest.p)'

[:foHo+-ig]

'you/they used to see'

[£+Hme+ig] 'you/they see(SS) ·· '

[fe+fe+ig]

'as you/they see(SS) ·· '

[fe+fe+ig+in] 'as you/they see(DS) ·· '

In the present tense, however, the form is

[:fe+gi-+na]

'you/they are seeing'

with the reverse sequence {gi} representing second/third

person plural. A gramnatically conditioned rretathesis rule

is therefore required.

[14]

ig -> gi

[2/3p present]

(ii) In the habitual past tense the rrorpheme {-lo}

represents habitual aspect. The sequence {-lo} occurs in

all forms except first person singular where the sequence is

reversed as shown by the following paradigm:

ls [f+o1+ig]

2s [fo+l.o+g]

3s [fo+lo+i]

ld [fo+lo+u]

2/3d [fo+lo+si]

lp [fo+lo+b]

2/3p [fo+lo+ig]

A gramnatically conditioned rretathesis rule is therefore

required.

[15]

lo-> ol

[ls hab.p]

An alternative analysis for the ls form would be to say that

the o in the suffix -lo is simply deleted after the stem

final e has been changed to o.

i.e. /fe+lo+ig/ -> /fo+lo+ig/ -> [fol~ig]

(iii) In the sequential action verb the rrorpheme {-me}

represents sarre subject following. This sequence ~s in

all forms except the first person singular where the

sequence is reversed and the /e/ coalesces with the

predicate narker {-i}. This is illustrated by the following

paradigm:

ls [:fH-fml-ig]

2s [£+Hme+g]

3s [f+Hme+i]

ld [£+Hne+u]

2/3d [f+i-fne+si]

371

Phonology

lp [:ft-iine+b] 2/3p [:ft-i:+me+iq] A gramnatically a:nditioned metathesis rule is therefore required.

The follOlf.li.ng deletion processes cx::cur:

(i) VCMel deletion.

A rule of vowel deletion is required for t:):le first person

singular habitual past tense form, assund.ng that the

metathesis rule, [15], applies.

/fet-JDHq/ -> /f.etol.+iq/ -> [folig] 'I used to see'

/toJ-JD+-iq/ -> /totol.+ig/ -> ()mi.g] 'I used to cx:me'

The simplest solution would probably be to have a rule of

verb stem vowel deletion a:nditioned by the gramna.tical

" environment: [19]

verb stem-V -> verb stem-¢

The first part of rule [23] defines all the second person

3. 4. 5. Reiduplication.

Reduplication is a a:mron way of marking various syntactic and semantic categories (see 2.1.3.3.2.1.2. (imperfective aspect), 2.1.3.3.2.1.8. (iterative aspect), 1. 16.1. (nouns) and 1.16.4. (adjectives)). The first (C)V of
the verb, noun or adjective stem can be reduplicated and in
the case of the verbs other parts of the verb can be
reduplicated like the object marker, the subject marker or the predicate marker.

1. The sequence [wu] is extremely rare and does not cxx:ur word initially.
376

Phonology
2. The basis for this analysis is taken from Keyser (1973) and Ladefoged (1975:245).
3. A limited nunber of lexical items begin with phonetic [k]. These items are analyzed as instances of the
independent phoneme /kl (see 3.1.2.1.1.). 4. The sequences /ju/ and /wu/ occur in only a few
lexical items. 5. These are fonns where it is kn0N11 that the underly-
ing fonn is /~/. In actuality they are realized by the allophone [p].
6. The corrq:arisons are taken from Z' graggen (1980 ) · 7. The inalienably possessed nouns are divided into 31 classes depending on the oonjugation of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person fonns (see 2.1.1.4.7.1.).
8. p = plural possessee.
9. It is not clear in this derivation why the vowel assimilation rule fails to operate on the verb stem also.
10. This derivation would indicate that reduplication operates after vowel assimilation.
11. All examples are taken from Z'graggen (1980) · 12. Kiparsky's definition of opacity (Kiparsky 1971, 1973): A process P of the fonn A -> B / C_D is opaque to the extent that there are phonetic fonns in the language having: (i) A in environment C D (ii)(a) B derived by process Pin an envirorunent other
than C D
(ii) (b) B not derived by process P in the environment C D. 13:" These fonns are analyzed as having an epenthetic vowel /i/ inserted between the subject agreement marker and the tense marker. Alternatively one oould analyze these fonns as being another example of rretathesis changing the
sequence /ig/ -> /gi/ (see 3.4.2.) with an assimilation " process for /e/ -> /i/ applying before the rretathesis
applies. 14. This is an alternate fonn where the coalescence
rule also applies to the third person singular rrorpheme
{-i}.
15. Coalescence does not occur between the SS marker and the vowel in the second/third person plural suffix.
16. This fonn suggests that epenthesis occurs before coalescence, rules [17] and [18], otherwise the fonn *[huguna] 'I come' would be produced.
17. These fonns oould be analyzed as the epenthetic VOYJel hanronizing with the preceding vowel or assimilating to the preceding labio-velar (see rule [9]).

5.1. STRUCTURED SEMANTIC FIELDS.
5.1.1. Kinship tenni.nology.
Most kinship teTI!ls are inalienably possessed nouns (see also 2.1.1.4.7.1.). Sane teTI!IS are not, for example aba 'brother' , bi.da 'aunt' , tal 'nuclear family' , silml 'clan' , jcnml 'namesake', ewe! 'workman' and begabega 'orphan/slave'. Within the possessed noun system no formal (lexical) distinction is made between kinship by blood or partial blood. There is, however, a lexical distinction between some nuclear family teTI!IS (i.e. those teTI!IS that express a relationship involving marriagel) and other kinship teTI!ls in that the marriage teTI!ls have first person singular suffix-ni/-mi and the nonmarriage teTI!IS have first person singular suffix -i but this grarrmatical distinction does not appear to have any social or cultural significance. The teTI!IS are listed in table 5.1 below in first person foilll for male and female ego with the marriage teTI!ls listed first.

5.1.1. 4. Relatiooslrlp by ~an.

It is quite corrnon for children to be given to a relative to raise as their own child. There appear to be a nurriber of reasons for this. Sanetirnes it is to fulfill an obligation to a close relative, say a brother, and in this case it is usually the firstborn child that is given away. In other cases it may be that the child has been born illegitimately or the parents have divorced or died or rroved away to another area. The child is given to a relative who is willing to take it. The teTI!I used for such an adoptive arrangement is Uqa na. utena. 'he gives him food' · In other wards the adopting relatives take on the responsibility of raising the child and in all respects it becanes their own child. There is no special kinship teTillinology used for an adopted child however. Sanetirnes a person may be taken into a family frcm another language group - a different area altogether. For example many people cane into the Amele area either looking for better land to work or because they ~ are afraid of sorcery and witchcraft in their own areas. A teTill used for such people is bega./begabega which has the general meaning 'orpl,lan/hc:rneless'.
